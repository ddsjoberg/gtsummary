If you wish to report a bug, please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect.

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

If you're experiencing unexpected formatting when you print a {gtsummary} table, please ensure first that the same issue does not exist in the {gt} package before submitting the issue.
