DO NOT use this form to ask a question, or ask for assistance with an error. Instead, ask on <https://stackoverflow.com/> using the gtsummary tag.

If you have found a bug, please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect.

INCLUDE a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

If you're experiencing unexpected formatting when you print a {gtsummary} table with R markdown to PDF or RTF, please ensure first that the same issue does not exist in the {gt} package before submitting the issue. Note that {gt} is currently developing PDF and RTF output formats.
