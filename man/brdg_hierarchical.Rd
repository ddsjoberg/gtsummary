\description{
Bridge function for converting \code{tbl_hierarchical()} (and similar) cards to basic gtsummary objects.
All bridge functions begin with prefix \verb{brdg_*()}.

This file also contains helper functions for constructing the bridge,
referred to as the piers (supports for a bridge) and begin with \verb{pier_*()}.
\itemize{
\item \code{brdg_hierarchical()}: The bridge function ingests an ARD data frame and returns
a gtsummary table that includes \code{.$table_body} and a basic \code{.$table_styling}.
The \code{.$table_styling$header} data frame includes the header statistics.
Based on context, this function adds a column to the ARD data frame named
\code{"gts_column"}. This column is used during the reshaping in the \verb{pier_*()}
functions defining column names.
\item \verb{pier_*()}: these functions accept a cards tibble and returns a tibble
that is a piece of the \code{.$table_body}. Typically these will be stacked
to construct the final table body data frame. The ARD object passed here
will have two primary parts: the calculated summary statistics and the
attributes ARD. The attributes ARD is used for labeling. The ARD data frame
passed to this function must include a \code{"gts_column"} column, which is
added in \code{brdg_hierarchical()}.
