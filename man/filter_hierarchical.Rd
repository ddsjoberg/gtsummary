\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{tbl_hierarchical}, \code{tbl_hierarchical_count}, \code{tbl_ard_hierarchical})\cr
A hierarchical gtsummary table of class \code{'tbl_hierarchical'}, \code{'tbl_hierarchical_count'},
or \code{'tbl_ard_hierarchical'}.}

\item{...}{These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.}

\item{filter}{(\code{expression})\cr
An expression that is used to filter rows of the table. See the Details section below.}

\item{var}{(\code{\link[dplyr:dplyr_tidy_select]{tidy-select}})\cr
Hierarchy variable from \code{x} to perform filtering on. The variable must be present in \code{x$inputs$include}. If
\code{NULL}, the last hierarchy variable from \code{x} (\code{dplyr::last(x$inputs$include)}) will be used.}

\item{keep_empty}{(scalar \code{logical})\cr
Logical argument indicating whether to retain summary rows corresponding to table hierarchy sections that have had
all rows filtered out. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{quiet}{(\code{logical})\cr
Logical indicating whether to suppress any messaging. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a gtsummary table of the same class as \code{x}.

This function is used to filter hierarchical table rows. Filters are not applied to summary or overall rows.
}
\details{
The \code{filter} argument can be used to filter out rows of a table which do not meet the criteria provided as an
expression. Rows can be filtered on the values of any of the possible statistics (\code{n}, \code{p}, and \code{N}) provided they
are included at least once in the table, as well as the values of any \code{by} variables.

Additionally, filters can be applied on individual column values (if a \code{by} variable was specified) via the \code{n_XX},
\code{N_XX}, and \code{p_XX} statistics, where each \code{XX} represents the index of the column to select the statistic from. For
example, \code{filter = n_1 > 5} will check whether \code{n} values in the first column of the table are greater than 5 in each
row.

Overall statistics for each row can be used in filters via the \code{n_overall}, \code{N_overall}, and \code{p_overall} statistics.
If used in \code{filter}, overall statistics are derived within the filtering function. \code{n_overall} can only be derived if
\code{n} statistic is present in the table for the filter variable, \code{N_overall} if the \code{N} statistic is present for the
filter variable, and \code{p_overall} if both the \code{n} and \code{N} statistics are present for the filter variable.

By default, filters will be applied at the level of the innermost hierarchy variable, i.e. the last variable supplied
to \code{variables}. If filters should instead be applied at the level of one of the outer hierarchy variables, the \code{var}
parameter can be used to specify a different variable to filter on. When \code{var} is set to a different (outer) variable
and a level of the variable does not meet the filtering criteria then the section corresponding to that variable
level - including summary rows - and all sub-sections within that section will be removed.

If an overall column was added to the table (via \verb{add_overall())}) this column will not be used in any filters (i.e.
\code{n_overall} will not include the overall \code{n} in a given row).

Some examples of possible filters:
\itemize{
\item \code{filter = n > 5}: keep rows where one of the treatment groups observed more than 5 AEs
\item \code{filter = n == 2 & p < 0.05}: keep rows where one of the treatment groups observed exactly 2 AEs and one of the
treatment groups observed a proportion less than 5\%.
\item \code{filter = n_overall >= 4}: keep rows where there were 4 or more AEs observed across the row
\item \code{filter = mean(n) > 4 | n > 3}: keep rows where the mean number of AEs is 4 or more across the row or one of the
treatment groups observed more than 3 AEs
\item \code{filter = n_2 > 2}: keep rows where the \code{"Xanomeline High Dose"} treatment group observed more than 2 AEs
}
