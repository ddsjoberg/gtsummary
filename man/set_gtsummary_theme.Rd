Use this function to set preferences for the display of gtsummary tables.
The default formatting and styling throughout the gtsummary package are
taken from the published reporting guidelines of the top four urology
journals: European Urology, The Journal of Urology, Urology and
the British Journal of Urology International. Use this function to change
the default reporting style to match another journal, or your own
personal style.
