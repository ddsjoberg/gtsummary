\title{Butcher table}
\usage{
tbl_butcher(x, include = c("table_body", "table_styling"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{gtsummary})\cr
a gtsummary object}

\item{include}{(\code{character})\cr
names of additional elements to retain in the gtsummary
object. \code{c("table_body", "table_styling")} will always be retained.}
}
\value{
a gtsummary object
}
\description{
Some gtsummary objects can become large and the size becomes cumbersome
when working with the object.
The function removes all elements from a gtsummary object, except those
required to print the table. This may result in gtsummary functions
that add information or modify the table, such as \code{add_global_p()},
will no longer execute
after the excess elements have been removed (aka butchered). Of note,
the majority of \code{inline_text()} calls will continue to execute
properly.

# size comparison
