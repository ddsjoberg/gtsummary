# Note: Don't try to open the csv file with excel, as it contains utf-8 characters excel usually ruins the file
# when opening the file.


# Reading the .csv file:
gtsummary_translated <- read.csv("data-raw/gtsummary_translated.csv", encoding="UTF-8")

# If modified, the csv should be saved with:
write.table(gtsummary_translated, file = "data-raw/gtsummary_translated.csv", row.names = FALSE,
            sep = ",", quote = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
