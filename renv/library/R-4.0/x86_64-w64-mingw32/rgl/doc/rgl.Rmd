## Introduction

The `rgl` package is used to produce interactive 3-D plots.  It contains
high-level graphics commands modelled loosely after classic R graphics,
but working in three dimensions.  It also contains low level structure
inspired by (but incompatible with) the `grid` package.

This document gives an overview.  See the help pages for details.

For installation instructions, see the `README` file in the top
level directory of the source tarball 
`r paste0("rgl_", packageVersion("rgl"), ".tar.gz")` (or a later
version).


### About this document

This document was written in R Markdown, using the `knitr` package
for production.  It corresponds to `rgl` version 
`r packageVersion("rgl")`.

Most of the highlighted function names are HTML links.
The internal links should work in any browser; the links to
help topics should work if you view the vignette from
within the R help system.

The document includes WebGL figures.  To view these, you must have
Javascript and WebGL enabled in your browser.  Some older browsers
may not support this -- see https://get.webgl.org for tests
and links to a discussion.


## Basics and High Level Functions

The `r indexfns("plot3d")` function
plots points within an RGL window.  It is similar to the classic 
`r linkfn("plot", pkg="graphics")` function,
but works in 3 dimensions.

For example
```{r}
with(iris, plot3d(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, 
                  type="s", col=as.numeric(Species)))
```

\noindent
can be used to plot three columns of the `iris` data.
Allowed plot types include `"p", "l", "h", "s"`,
meaning points, lines, segments from z=0, and spheres.  There's
a lot of flexibility in specifying the coordinates; the 
`r linkfn("xyz.coords", pkg = "grDevices")` function
from the `grDevices` package is used for this.

You can use your mouse to manipulate the plot.  The default is that
if you click and hold with the left mouse button, you can rotate 
the plot by dragging it.  The right mouse button is used to resize
it, and the middle button changes the perspective in the point of view.

If you call `r linkfn("plot3d")` again, it will overwrite the current plot.
To open a new graphics window, use `r linkfn("open3d")`.
 
The other high level function is `r indexfns("persp3d")` to draw surfaces.
It is
similar to the classic `r linkfn("persp", pkg = "graphics")`
function, but with greater flexibility.
First, any of `x`, `y` or `z`
can be specified using matrices, not just `z`.  This allows parametric
surfaces to be plotted. 
An even simpler specification is possible:  `x` may be a function,
in which case `persp3d` will work out the grid itself.  See 
`r linkfn("persp3d.function", text="?persp3d.function", pkg="rgl")`
for details.  For example, the `MASS` package estimates
Gamma parameters using maximum likelihood in a 
`r linkfn("fitdistr", text="?MASS::fitdistr", pkg="MASS")` example.
Here we show the log likelihood surface. 
```{r persp3d, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.keep="last"}
library(MASS)
# from the fitdistr example
set.seed(123)
x <- rgamma(100, shape = 5, rate = 0.1)
fit <- fitdistr(x, dgamma, list(shape = 1, rate = 0.1), lower = 0.001)
loglik <- function(shape, rate) sum(dgamma(x, shape=shape, rate=rate, 
                                           log=TRUE))
loglik <- Vectorize(loglik)
xlim <- fit$estimate[1]+4*fit$sd[1]*c(-1,1)
ylim <- fit$estimate[2]+4*fit$sd[2]*c(-1,1)

mfrow3d(1, 2, sharedMouse = TRUE)
persp3d(loglik, 
        xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim,
        n = 30)
zlim <- fit$loglik + c(-qchisq(0.99, 2)/2, 0)
next3d()
persp3d(loglik, 
        xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, zlim = zlim,
        n = 30)
```
 On the left, the whole surface over a range of the parameters; on the right, only the 
parts of the surface with log likelihood values near the maximum.

Note:  this example used the `knitr` hook functions 
(see `r linkfn("setupKnitr")`) to insert the
scene into this vignette; the previous example used the `rglwidget`
function.  We generally
recommend the newer `r linkfn("rglwidget")` approach.

Note that both `plot3d` and `persp3d` are generic functions,
with the following methods defined:
```{r}
methods(plot3d)
methods(persp3d)
```


## Adding Graphical Elements

### Primitive shapes

Just as we have `r linkfn("points", pkg="graphics")` and 
`r linkfn("lines", pkg="graphics")` in classic graphics, there are a number
of low level functions in `rgl` to add graphical elements to the
currently active plot.  The "primitive" shapes are those that are 
native to OpenGL:

Function                      | Description
----------------------------- | -----------
`r indexfns("points3d")`:     | adds points
`r indexfns("lines3d")`:      | adds lines
`r indexfns("segments3d")`:   | adds line segments
`r indexfns("triangles3d")`:  | adds triangles
`r indexfns("quads3d")`:      | adds quadrilaterals

Each of the above functions takes arguments `x`, `y` and `z`, again
using `r linkfn("xyz.coords", pkg="grDevices")` for flexibility.
They group successive entries
as necessary.  For example, the `r linkfn("triangles3d")` function takes each
successive triple of points as the vertices of a triangle.

You can use these functions to annotate the current graph, or to 
construct a figure from scratch.

### Constructed shapes

`rgl` also has a number of objects which it constructs
from the primitives.

Function                      | Description
----------------------------- | -----------
`r indexfns(c("text3d", "texts3d"))`: | adds text
`r indexfns("abclines3d")`:   | adds straight lines to plot (like `abline`)
`r indexfns("arc3d")`:        | adds spherical arcs or spirals to plot
`r indexfns("planes3d")`:     | adds planes to plot
`r indexfns("clipplanes3d")`: | add clipping planes to plot
`r indexfns(c("sprites3d", "particles3d"))`: | add sprites (fixed shapes or images) to plot
`r indexfns("spheres3d")`:    | adds spheres
`r indexfns(c("surface3d", "terrain3d"))`:    | a surface (as used in `r linkfn("persp3d")`)
`r indexfns("drape3d")`:      | drapes lines on a surface or object(s)
`r indexfns("shadow3d")`:     | projects mesh onto a surface
`r indexfns("arrow3d")`:      | add an arrow to a scene
`r indexfns("pch3d")`:	      | draw base-style plotting symbols
`r indexfns("plotmath3d")`:   | used by `r linkfn("text3d")` for math text

### Axes and other "decorations"

The following low-level functions control the look of the graph:

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
`r indexfns(c("axes3d", "axis3d"))`: | add axes to plot
`r indexfns(c("box3d", "bbox3d"))`:               | add box around plot
`r indexfns("title3d")`:             | add title to plot
`r indexfns("mtext3d")`:             | add marginal text to plot
`r indexfns("decorate3d")`:          | add multiple "decorations" (scales, etc.) to plot
`r indexfns("aspect3d")`:            | set the aspect ratios for the plot
`r indexfns(c("bg3d", "bgplot3d"))`: | set the background of the scene
`r indexfns("show2d")`:              | show a 2D plot or image in a 3D scene
`r indexfns("legend3d")`:            | set a legend for the scene
`r indexfns("grid3d")`:              | add a reference grid to a graph
`r indexfns("thigmophobe3d")`:       | choose label positions to avoid overlap

For example, to plot three random triangles, one could use
```{r fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
triangles3d(cbind(x=rnorm(9), y=rnorm(9), z=rnorm(9)), col = "green")
decorate3d()
bg3d("lightgray")
aspect3d(1,1,1)
```

Besides the `*3d` functions mentioned above, there are even lower-level
functions 
`r indexfns(c("rgl.primitive", "rgl.points", "rgl.linestrips", "rgl.lines", "rgl.triangles",
"rgl.quads", "rgl.texts", "rgl.abclines", "rgl.planes", "rgl.bg",
"rgl.clipplanes", "rgl.bbox", "rgl.spheres", "rgl.sprites", "rgl.surface"))`.  
You should avoid using these functions, which do not
work well with the higher level `*3d` functions.  See the 
`r linkfn("r3d", text="?r3d", pkg="rgl")` help
topic for details.

## Controlling the Look of the Scene

### Lighting

In most scenes, objects are "lit", meaning that their appearance
depends on their position and orientation relative to lights
in the scene.  The lights themselves don't normally show up,
but their effect on the objects does.

Use the `r indexfns("light3d")` function to 
specify the position and characteristics of a light.
Lights may be infinitely distant, or may be embedded
within the scene.  Their characteristics include 
`ambient`, `diffuse`, and `specular` components, all
defaulting to white.  The `ambient` component appears
the same from any direction.  The `diffuse` component 
depends on the angle between the surface and the light, 
while the `specular` component also takes the viewer's
position into account.

The `r indexfns("rgl.light")` function is a lower-level
function with different defaults; users should normally
use `r linkfn("light3d")`.

### Materials

The mental model used in `rgl` is that the objects being shown
in scenes are physical objects in space, with material properties
that affect how light reflects from them (or is emitted by them).
These are mainly controlled by the `r indexfns("material3d")` function,
or by arguments to other functions that are passed to it.

The material properties that can be set by calls to `material3d` are
described in detail in the 
`r linkfn("material3d", text="?material3d", pkg="rgl")` help page.
Here we give an overview.

Property  | Default | Meaning 
--------- | ------- | ------------------
color     | white   | vector of surface colors to apply to successive vertices for diffuse light
alpha     | 1       | transparency:  0 is invisible, 1 is opaque
lit       | TRUE    | whether lighting calculations should be done
ambient   | black   | color in ambient  light
specular  | white   | color in specular light
emission  | black   | color emitted by the surface
shininess | 50      | controls the specular lighting:  high values look shiny
smooth    | TRUE    | whether shading should be interpolated between vertices
texture   | NULL    | optional path to a "texture" bitmap to be displayed on the surface
front, back | fill  | should polygons be filled, or outlined? 
size      | 3       | size of points in pixels
lwd       | 1       | width of lines in pixels

Other properties include 
"texmipmap", "texmagfilter", "texminfilter", "texenvmap", "fog", 
"point\_antialias", "line\_antialias", "depth\_mask", "depth\_test" and "polygon_offset"; 
see `r linkfn("material3d", "the help page", pkg = "rgl")` for details.

There is also an `r indexfns("rgl.material")` function that works
at a lower level; users should normally avoid it.

### Textures

As described in the previous section, one of the material
properties is `texture`, the name of a bitmap file (in `.png`
format) containing an image to be displayed on the surface. 
This section gives more details about textures.

In `OpenGL`, each vertex in a polygon may be associated with a
particular location in the bitmap.  The interior of the
polygon interpolates within the bitmap.  There are two 
conventions in `rgl` functions for specifying these coordinates.

Functions which specify primitives (`r linkfn("triangles3d")`, etc.) accept an optional matrix argument
`texcoords` which gives `s` (horizontal) and `t` (vertical)
locations within the bitmap in columns with one row per vertex.
The coordinates are `(0,0)` for the lower left, and `(1,1)`
for the upper right.  If values outside this range are given,
the image repeats, i.e. `(1.1, 1.1)` would specify the same
point in the image as `(0.1, 0.1)`.

Other functions such as `r linkfn("surface3d")` that take
matrices for each vertex coordinate accept texture coordinates
as matrices as well, in arguments `texture_s` and `texture_t`.

For example, the 
following code displays four copies of a 2D plot on a quad, 
because the texture coordinates run from 0 to 2 in both
`s` and `t`:

```{r}
filename <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
png(filename = filename)
plot(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000))
dev.off()
open3d()
xyz <- cbind(c(0,1,1,0), 0, c(0,0,1,1))
quads3d(xyz, texture = filename, texcoords = xyz[,c(1, 3)]*2, col = "white", specular = "black")
```

Some other notes:

 - The color in the figure above was specified to be white.  By default,
the colors in the bitmap will modify the colour of the
quad.  If `col` is black (a common default), you won't see anything.
 - On the other hand, you usually don't want specular 
 reflections (which show up as glare).  Setting `specular`
 to black prevents those.
 - How the bitmap is handled is controlled by the material
 property `"textype"`.  The default is `"rgb"`, which 
 takes the red-green-blue colours from the bitmap and
 uses them to modify the corresponding colours in the polygon.  Other possibilities for `"textype"` are described
 in `r linkfn("material3d", "the material3d help page", pkg = "rgl")`.
 - The other `"tex*"` material properties control how 
 the interpolation within the image is done.
 - Modern `OpenGL` supports 1- and 3-dimensional textures;
 these are not supported in `rgl`.
 
### Fonts

`rgl` uses the same ideas as base graphics for drawing
text:  there are font families named `"sans"`,
`"serif"`, and `"mono"` for drawing text of those
types.  In `rgl`, the `"symbol"` family is not supported.

New font families can be defined using the low-level
function `r indexfns("rglFonts")`, or more simply
using the higher level function 
`r indexfns("rglExtrafonts")`.  The latter function
requires the `extrafont` package to be installed.

### par3d:  Miscellaneous graphical parameters

The `r indexfns("par3d")` function, modelled after the classic
graphics `r linkfn("par", pkg="graphics")` function, sets or reads 
a variety of different `rgl` internal
parameters.  Some parameters are completely read-only; others are
fixed at the time the window is opened, and others may be changed 
at any time.

Name        |  Changeable?     | Description
----------- | ----- | -----------
antialias   | fixed | Amount of hardware antialiasing 
cex         |       | Default size for text
family      |       | Device-independent font family name; see `r linkfn("text3d", text="?text3d", pkg="rgl")`
font        |       | Integer font number
useFreeType |       | Should FreeType fonts be used if available?
fontname    | read-only | System-dependent font name set by `r linkfn("rglFonts")`
FOV         |       | Field of view, in degrees.  Zero means isometric perspective
ignoreExtent |      | Should `rgl` ignore the size of new objects when computing the bounding box?
skipRedraw   |      | Should `rgl` suppress updates to the display? 
maxClipPlanes | read-only | How many clip planes can be defined?
modelMatrix | read-only | The OpenGL ModelView matrix; partly set by `r indexfns("view3d")` or the obsolete `r indexfns("rgl.viewpoint")`
projMatrix  | read-only | The OpenGL Projection matrix
bbox        | read-only | Current bounding-box of the scene
viewport    |       | Dimensions in pixels of the scene within the window
windowRect  |           | Dimensions in pixels of the window on the whole screen
listeners   |           | Which subscenes respond to mouse actions in the current one
mouseMode   |       | What the mouse buttons do.  See `r linkfn("mouseMode", '<code>"mouseMode"</code>')`
observer    | read-only | The position of the observer; set by `r indexfns("observer3d")`
scale       |           | Rescaling for each coordinate; see `r linkfn("aspect3d")`
zoom        |           | Magnification of the scene

### Default settings

The `r indexfns("r3dDefaults")` list and the `r indexfns("getr3dDefaults")` 
function control defaults in new windows opened by `r linkfn("open3d")`.  
The function looks for the variable in the user's global environment,
and if not found there, finds the one in the `rgl` namespace.  This
allows the user to override the default settings for new windows.

Once found, the `r3dDefaults` list provides initial values for `r linkfn("par3d")` parameters, as well as defaults for `r linkfn("material3d")` and `r linkfn("bg3d")` in components `"material"`
and `"bg"` respectively.


## Meshes:  Constructing Shapes 

`rgl` includes a number of functions to construct and display 
various solid shapes.  These generate objects of class `"shape3d"`,
`"mesh3d"` or `"shapelist3d"`.  The details of the classes are 
described below.  We start with functions to generate them.

### Specific solids

These functions generate specific shapes.  Optional arguments allow
attributes such as colour or transformations to be specified.

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
`r indexfns(c("tetrahedron3d", "cube3d", "octahedron3d", "dodecahedron3d", "icosahedron3d"))`: | Platonic solids
`r indexfns(c("cuboctahedron3d", "oh3d"))`:             | other solids

```{r}
cols <- rainbow(7)
layout3d(matrix(1:16, 4,4), heights=c(1,3,1,3))
text3d(0,0,0,"tetrahedron3d"); next3d()
shade3d(tetrahedron3d(col=cols[1])); next3d()
text3d(0,0,0,"cube3d"); next3d()
shade3d(cube3d(col=cols[2])); next3d()
text3d(0,0,0,"octahedron3d"); next3d()
shade3d(octahedron3d(col=cols[3])); next3d()
text3d(0,0,0,"dodecahedron3d"); next3d()
shade3d(dodecahedron3d(col=cols[4])); next3d()
text3d(0,0,0,"icosahedron3d"); next3d()
shade3d(icosahedron3d(col=cols[5])); next3d()
text3d(0,0,0,"cuboctahedron3d"); next3d()
shade3d(cuboctahedron3d(col=cols[6])); next3d()
text3d(0,0,0,"oh3d"); next3d()
shade3d(oh3d(col=cols[7]))
```

A very large collection of polyhedra is contained in the 
`r linkfn("Rpolyhedra-package", text = "Rpolyhedra", pkg = "Rpolyhedra")` 
package.

### Generating new shapes 

These functions generate new shapes:

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
`r indexfns("cylinder3d")`: | generate a tube or cylinder
`r indexfns("polygon3d")`:  | generate a flat polygon by triangulation
`r indexfns("extrude3d")`:  | generate an "extrusion" of a polygon
`r indexfns("turn3d")`:     | generate a solid of rotation
`r indexfns("ellipse3d")`:  | generate an ellipsoid in various ways
`r indexfns("mesh3d")`:      | generate a shape from indexed vertices
`r indexfns("shapelist3d")`: | generate a shape by combining other shapes
`as.mesh3d`:                 | a generic function; see below

A related function is `r indexfns("triangulate")`, which takes a
two dimensional polygon and divides it up into triangles using the 
"ear-clipping" algorithm.

The generic function `r indexfns("as.mesh3d")`
is provided to allow data structures produced by
other code to be converted to mesh
structures.  Currently the following classes
are supported:

Class |  Package | Description
----- |  ------- | -----------
`r indexfns("deldir", pkg = "deldir")` | `deldir` | Delaunay triangulations of irregular point clouds 
`r indexfns("triSht", pkg = "interp")` | `interp` | Also Delaunay triangulations
`r indexfns("tri", pkg = "tripack")` | `tripack` | Generalized Delaunay triangulations
`r indexfns("ashape3d", pkg = "alphashape3d")` | `alphashape3d` | Alpha-shapes
`r linkfn("rglId")` | `rgl` | `rgl` object identifiers

The default `r indexfns("as.mesh3d.default")` method is a simple way
to construct a mesh from a matrix of vertices; it can use
`r indexfns("mergeVertices")` (which can also be used on its own)
to merge repeated vertices within the matrix, allowing 
`r linkfn("addNormals")` to be used to give a smooth appearance.

Functions `r indexfns(c("tmesh3d","qmesh3d"))` are now obsolete;
use `r linkfn("mesh3d")` instead.

### The underlying class structure for shapes

`"shape3d"` is the basic abstract type.  Objects of this class can be
displayed by `r indexfns("shade3d")` (which shades faces), 
`r indexfns("wire3d")` (which draws edges), or `r indexfns("dot3d")`
(which draws points at each vertex.)  

`"mesh3d"` is a descendant type.  Objects of this type contain the following 
fields:

Field        | Meaning
------------ | ---------------
vb           | A 4 by n matrix of vertices in homogeneous coordinates.  Each column is a point.
ip           | (optional) A vector of vertex indices for points.
is           | (optional) A 2 by s matrix of vertex indices. Each column is a line segment.
it           | (optional) A 3 by t matrix of vertex indices.  Each column is a triangle.
ib           | (optional) A 4 by q matrix of vertex indices.  Each column is a quadrilateral.
material     | (optional) A list of material properties.
normals      | (optional) A matrix of the same shape as vb, containing normal vectors at each vertex.
texcoords    | (optional) A 2 by n matrix of texture coordinates corresponding to each vertex.
values       | (optional) A vector of length n holding values at each vertex
meshColor    | (optional) A text value indicating how colors and texture coordinates should be interpreted.


### Contouring shapes

These functions compute and plot contours of functions
on surfaces, or clip objects along a contour of a function.

Function                         | Description
-------------------------------- | -----------
`r indexfns("contourLines3d")`:  | draw contour lines on surface
`r indexfns("filledContour3d")`: | fill between contours on surface
`r indexfns("clipMesh3d")`:      | clip mesh object using curved boundary
`r indexfns("clipObj3d")`:       | clip general object using curved boundary

### Manipulating shapes

These functions manipulate and modify mesh objects:

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
`r indexfns("addNormals")`: | add normal vectors to make a shape look smooth
`r indexfns("subdivision3d")`: | add extra vertices to make it look even smoother
`r indexfns("merge.mesh3d", backticked("merge"))`: | merge mesh objects
`r indexfns("facing3d")`:   | subset of mesh facing "up"     

The individual steps in `r linkfn("subdivision3d")` are also available:
`r indexfns(c("deform.mesh3d", "divide.mesh3d", "normalize.mesh3d"))`. These
are mainly intended for internal use.

## Multi-figure Layouts

`rgl` has several functions to support displaying multiple different
"subscenes" in the same window.  The high level functions are

Function                  | Description
------------------------- | -----------
`r indexfns("mfrow3d")`:  | Multiple figures (like `r linkfn("par", text = 'par("mfrow")', pkg="graphics")`
`r indexfns("layout3d")`: | Multiple figures (like `r linkfn("layout", pkg="graphics")`)
`r indexfns("next3d")`:   | Move to the next figure (like `r linkfn("plot.new", pkg="graphics")` or `r linkfn("frame", pkg="graphics")`)
`r indexfns("subsceneList")`: | List all the subscenes in the current layout
`r indexfns("clearSubsceneList")`: | Clear the current list and revert to the previous one

There are also lower level functions.

Function                           | Description
---------------------------------- | -----------
`r indexfns("newSubscene3d")`:     | Create a new subscene, with fine control over what is inherited from the parent
`r indexfns("currentSubscene3d")`: | Report on the active subscene
`r indexfns("subsceneInfo")`:      | Get information on current subscene
`r indexfns("useSubscene3d")`:     | Make a different subscene active
`r indexfns(c("addToSubscene3d", "delFromSubscene3d"))`: | Add objects to a subscene, or delete them
`r indexfns("gc3d")`:              | Do "garbage collection":  delete objects that are not displayed in any subscene

## Documents with `rgl` Scenes

The `rgl` package can produce output that can be embedded
in other documents.  The recommended way to do this has changed several
times over the years.  We will start with the current
recommendation, then list older methods.

### The recommended method

Currently the best way to embed an `rgl` scene in a document
is to produce the document in HTML using R Markdown.  Early in
the document, you should have code like this in one of the
setup code chunks:

````markdown
`r ''````{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(rgl)
setupKnitr(autoprint = TRUE)
```
````

The call to `setupKnitr()` will install a number of hooks
and set options in `knitr` so that `rgl` code is handled properly.
The `autoprint = TRUE` argument makes `rgl` act in the document
almost the same way it would act in the console, or the way 
base graphics are handled by `knitr`:  If you print the value
of high level `rgl` functions, a plot will be inserted into the
output, but maybe only after low level modifications to it are
complete.  For example, this code block prints both
triangles and spheres in a single plot at the end:

```{r}
xyz <- matrix(rnorm(27), ncol = 3)
triangles3d(xyz, col = rainbow(9))
spheres3d(xyz, col = rainbow(9), radius = 0.1)
```

There are a few differences if you have a complicated situation:

  -  The mechanism depends on the result of the `rgl` function
  calls being automatically printed.
  If the calls are in a loop or other code block where automatic
  printing doesn't happen, you'll need some trickery to get 
  things to print.  For example, this will print three plots:
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
plots <- NULL
for (i in 1:3) {
  plot3d(rnorm(10), rnorm(10), rnorm(10))
  plots <- htmltools::tagList(plots, rglwidget())
  close3d()
}
plots
```

  - It also depends on the fact that `rgl` functions return
  results using `lowlevel()` or `highlevel()` to mark which
  kind of plot they are.  If you are using a function from
  another package to produce the plot, you may need to insert
  an explicit call to one of those to get it to print.  Use `lowlevel()` if the function just modifies an existing plot, 
  `highlevel()` if it starts a new one.  For example,
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
foreignHigh()   # Produces a high level plot, but doesn't return
                # an appropriate value
highlevel()
foreignLow()    # Modifies the previous plot
lowlevel()
```  

This should display the output at the end of the code chunk, when
modifications are assumed complete.

### Producing PDF output

While some PDF previewers support interactive 3D graphics,
most don't.  To produce a screenshot of an `rgl` scene in an R Markdown
document with PDF output, simply follow the directions given
above.  The auto-printing will detect PDF output and use
`snapshot3d` to produce a PNG file to insert.  (See below
if you want to insert a different format of graphic.)

If you really need interactive output, see the 
`r linkfn("writeASY")` function.

### Manual insertion of plots

You may not want to use the `setupKnitr(autoprint = TRUE)`
method described above.  It is very new, and may still have
bugs; you may have an older document and not want to edit it
to work that way.

In this case, you can insert plots manually.  Use setup
code

````markdown
`r ''````{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(rgl)
setupKnitr()
```
````

and call `rglwidget()` at top level whenever you want to 
insert a plot.

There are a couple of other differences in default behaviour if
you are not using `autoprint`:

 - By default, each code chunk continues the `rgl` scene from
earlier chunks.  You'll need an explicit `r linkfn("open3d")`
call to get a clean window.

 - Also by default, the `rgl` window is not closed at the end of
the chunk.  This probably doesn't matter, but you may find
you run out of memory if your scenes are really big.

### Older methods

The original way to insert an `rgl` scene in a document was to use
the `r indexfns("writeWebGL")` function to write HTML code to insert in a document. 
Later, `Sweave` and `knitr` hooks were added.  These are no longer maintained, and it is recommended that
you update old documents to use the newer methods.  See
the `r linkfn("writeWebGL")`, `r linkfn("rgl.Sweave")` and `r linkfn("hook_rgl")` help
topics for details on these if you must use them.  If you are
reading documents that suggest using those methods, let the
author know they need updating!
  
## Utility Functions


### User interaction

By default, `rgl` detects and handles mouse clicks within your scene,
and uses these to control its appearance.  You can find out the current
handlers using the following code:
```{r}
par3d("mouseMode")
```
The labels `c("left", "right", "middle")` refer to the buttons on
a three button mouse, or simulations of them on other mice.  `"wheel"` 
refers to the mouse wheel.

The button actions generally correspond to click and drag operations.
Possible values for `r indexfns("mouseMode", '<code>"mouseMode"</code>')` for buttons or the wheel are as follows:

Mode           | Description
-------------- | ---------
`"none"`       | No action
`"trackball"`  | The mouse acts as a virtual trackball. Clicking and dragging rotates the scene
`"xAxis"`, `"yAxis"`, `"zAxis"`      | Like `"trackball"`, but restricted to rotation about one axis
`"polar"`      | The mouse affects rotations by controlling polar coordinates directly
`"selecting"`  | The mouse is being used by the `r linkfn("select3d")` function
`"zoom"`       | The mouse zooms the display
`"fov"`        | The mouse affects perspective by changing the field of view
`"pull"`       | Rotating the mouse wheel towards the user "pulls the scene closer"
`"push"`       | The same rotation "pushes the scene away"
`"user"`       | A user action set by `r indexfns(c("rgl.setMouseCallbacks", "rgl.setWheelCallback"))`.  Use `r indexfns("rgl.getMouseCallbacks")` and `r indexfns("rgl.getWheelCallback")` to retrieve

The following functions make use of the mouse for selection within a 
scene.

Function                     | Description
---------------------------- | -----------
`r indexfns("identify3d")`:   | like the classic graphics `r linkfn("identify", pkg="graphics")` function
`r indexfns("select3d")`:     | returns a function that tests whether a coordinate was selected
`r indexfns("selectpoints3d")`: | selects from specific objects

`r indexfns("selectionFunction3d")` produces the selection
function from information about the projection and mouse
selection region; it is used internally in the 
functions above.

The `r indexfns("rgl.select3d")` function is an obsolete version of
`select3d`, and `r indexfns("rgl.select")` is a low-level support
function.


### Animations

`rgl` has several functions that can be used to construct
animations.  These are based on functions that update the
scene according to the current real-world time, and repeated
calls to those.  The functions are:

Function               | Description
---------------------- | -------------
`r indexfns("play3d")`: | Repeatedly call the update function 
`r indexfns("spin3d")`: | Update the display by rotating at a constant rate
`r indexfns("par3dinterp")`: | Compute new values of some `r linkfn("par3d")` parameters by interpolation over time

See the `r linkfn("movie3d")` function for a way to output an animation
to a file on disk.  
Animations are not currently supported 
in the HTML written by `r linkfn("rglwidget")`, though the
`playwidget` function provides equivalent functionality.

### Integration with TCL/TK

There are three functions in `rgl` that support control of an `rgl`
scene using the TCL/TK framework.

Function               | Description
---------------------- | -------------
`r indexfns("tkspin3d")`: | Set up buttons in a window to control a scene 
`r indexfns("tkspinControl")`: | Embed the control buttons in a separate TCL/TK frame
`r indexfns("tkpar3dsave")`: | Create a dialog to interactively save mouse actions

These functions were formerly contained (without the `tk` prefixes on 
their names) in the `tkrgl` package.  That package is now deprecated.

### Exporting and importing scenes

`rgl` contains several functions to write scenes to disk for use
by other software, or to read them in.

In order from highest fidelity to lowest, the functions are:

Function    | Description
----------- | -------------
`r indexfns("scene3d")`:    | Save a scene to an R variable, which can be saved and reloaded
`r indexfns("rglwidget")`: | Prints as HTML and Javascript to display a scene in a web browser.  (See also [User Interaction in WebGL](WebGL.html).)
`r linkfn("writeWebGL")`: | Deprecated.
`r indexfns("writeASY")`:   | Write files for Asymptote
`r indexfns("writePLY")`:   | Write PLY files (commonly used in 3D printing)
`r indexfns(c("readOBJ", "writeOBJ"))`:   | Read or write OBJ files (commonly used in 3D graphics)
`r indexfns(c("readSTL", "writeSTL"))`:   | Read or write STL files (also common in 3D printing)

There are also functions to save snapshots or other recordings of a scene,
without any 3D information being saved:

Function     | Description
------------ | -------------
`r indexfns("snapshot3d")`: | Save a PNG file bitmap of the scene
`r indexfns("rgl.postscript")`: | Save a Postscript, LaTeX, PDF, SVG or PGF vector rendering of the scene
`r indexfns("movie3d")`:    | Save a series of bitmaps to be assembled into a movie
`r indexfns("rgl.pixels")`: | Obtain pixel-level information about the scene in an R variable
`r indexfns("rgl.Sweave")`: | Driver function for inserting a snapshot into a Sweave document.
`r indexfns(c("hook_rgl", "hook_webgl"))`: | `knitr` hook functions for inserting images into a document.
`r indexfns("setupKnitr")`: | Function to set up `knitr` hooks

The `r indexfns("rgl.snapshot")` function is a low level
version of `snapshot3d()`; it requires that the `rgl` display
be onscreen and copies from there.  `snapshot3d()` tries to 
use the `webshot2` package so it will work even with no display.
The functions `r indexfns(c("rgl.Sweave.off", "Sweave.snapshot"))` are 
involved in Sweave processing and not normally called by users.


### Default display

There are two ways in which `rgl` scenes are normally
displayed within R.  The older one is in a dedicated
window.  In Unix-alikes this is an X11 window;  it is
a native window in Microsoft Windows.  On macOS, the
XQuartz system (see https://www.xquartz.org) needs to be
installed to support this.

To suppress this display, set `options(rgl.useNULL = TRUE)` before opening a new `rgl` window.  See
the help page for the `r indexfns("rgl.useNULL")` function
for how to set this before starting R.

The newer way to display a scene is by using WebGL
in a browser window or in the Viewer pane in RStudio.
To select this, set `options(rgl.printRglwidget = TRUE)`.
Each operation that would change the scene will 
return a value which triggers a new WebGL display
when printed.

### Working with WebGL scenes

You should use the following scheme for exporting a scene to a web page.  There's also an older scheme, which is no longer 
supported.

The recommended approach works with the `htmlwidgets` framework
(see http://www.htmlwidgets.org/).  In an R Markdown document
in `knitr`, use the 
`r linkfn("rglwidget")` function.  (You can also use
chunk option `webgl=TRUE`; we recommend the explicit use of
`rglwidget`.)  This approach also
allows display of `rgl` scenes in
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).  Besides 
`rgl` scenes, various controls for them can
be displayed, and there are a few utility functions
that can be useful:

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -------------
`r indexfns("propertyControl")`:       | set individual properties
`r indexfns("clipplaneControl")`:       |  control a clipping plane
`r indexfns("subsetControl")`:       | control which objects are displayed
`r indexfns("ageControl")`:       | "age" vertices of an object
`r indexfns("vertexControl")`:       | control properties of vertices
`r indexfns("par3dinterpControl")`:  | WebGL control like `r linkfn("par3dinterp")`
`r indexfns("playwidget")`:       | display and automate controls
`r indexfns("toggleWidget")`:     | display a button to toggle some items
`r documentedfns <- c(documentedfns, "%>%");indexfns("pipe", text="%>%")`:    | `magrittr` pipe
`r indexfns(c("figHeight", "figWidth"))`:     | Dimensions of figures in R Markdown document
`r indexfns("rglShared")`:        | share data using `crosstalk` package
`r indexfns("rglMouse")`:         | change mouse mode in RGL scene
`r indexfns("asRow")`:            | arrange multiple objects in an HTML display
`r indexfns("getWidgetId")`:      | get the `elementId` from a widget

These functions work with the above scheme in Shiny apps:

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -------------
`r indexfns("sceneChange")`:      | used in `Shiny` for large scene changes
`r indexfns(c("shinyGetPar3d", "shinySetPar3d"))`: | get or set `r linkfn("par3d")` values from Shiny
`r indexfns("shinyResetBrush")`:  | reset the mouse brush in Shiny

The `r linkfn("selectionFunction3d")` function is also likely
to be involved in mouse interactions when using Shiny.

Some functions are mainly for internal use:
`r indexfns(c("elementId2Prefix", "playwidgetOutput", "renderPlaywidget", "rglwidgetOutput", "renderRglwidget", "registerSceneChange"))`. 
More details are given in the vignette 
[User Interaction in WebGL](WebGL.html).
The functions `r indexfns(c("lowlevel", "highlevel", "rglId"))` are also for internal use,
marking function results for automatic
printing.  Finally, the experimental function
`r indexfns("setUserShaders")` allows you to
use hand-written shaders in WebGL.

The older approach uses the `r linkfn("writeWebGL")` function to export a scene 
to HTML and Javascript code.  
These functions write HTML and Javascript for working with the 
exported scene:  `r indexfns("propertySlider")`,
`r indexfns("clipplaneSlider")`, `r indexfns("subsetSlider")`,
`r indexfns("toggleButton")`, `r indexfns("propertySetter")`,
`r indexfns("subsetSetter")`, `r indexfns("ageSetter")`, 
`r indexfns("par3dinterpSetter")`, 
`r indexfns("vertexSetter")`, `r indexfns("matrixSetter")`.
Use the newer functions instead.

### Working with the scene

`rgl` maintains internal structures for all the scenes it displays.
The following functions allow users to find information about them
and manipulate them.  In cases where there are both `*3d`
and `rgl.*` versions of functions, most users should use
the `*3d` version:  the `rgl.*` functions are more primitive
and are mainly intended for internal use.

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
`r indexfns("open3d")`:               | open a new window
`r indexfns(c("close3d", "rgl.close"))`:              | close the current window
`r indexfns(c("cur3d", "rgl.cur"))`:                | id of the active device
`r indexfns(c("set3d", "rgl.set"))`:                | set a particular device to be active
`r indexfns(c("pop3d", "rgl.pop"))`:     | delete an object from the scene
`r indexfns(c("clear3d", "rgl.clear"))`:            | delete all objects of certain classes
`r indexfns(c("ids3d", "rgl.ids"))`:              | ids and types of all current objects

These functions are mainly intended for programming, and 
have no corresponding `*3d` counterparts:

Function | Description
------------- | -----------
`r indexfns("rgl.bringtotop")`: | bring the current window to the top
`r indexfns("rgl.dev.list")`:   | ids of all active devices
`r indexfns(c("rgl.attrib", "rgl.attrib.info", "rgl.attrib.count"))`: | attributes of objects in the scene
`r indexfns("rgl.projection")`: | return information about the current projection
`r indexfns(c("rgl.user2window", "rgl.window2user"))`: | convert between coordinates in the current projection

The `r indexfns("as.triangles3d")` generic function is intended to 
extract coordinates in a form suitable for passing to 
`r linkfn("triangles3d")`.  Currently a method is provided for
`r linkfn("rglId")` objects.

In addition to these, there are some other related functions which
should rarely be called by users: `r indexfns(c("rgl.init", "rgl.open", "rgl.quit"))`.  


### Working with 3-D vectors

Most `rgl` functions work internally with "homogeneous" coordinates.
In this system, 3-D points are represented with 4 coordinates, generally
called (x, y, z, w).  The corresponding Euclidean point is
(x/w, y/w, z/w), if w is nonzero; zero values of w correspond to 
"points at infinity".  The advantage of this system is that
affine transformations including translations and perspective shifts
become linear transformations, with multiplication by a 4 by 4 matrix.

`rgl` has the following functions to work with homogeneous coordinates:

Function                             | Description
------------------------------------ | -----------
`r indexfns(c("asEuclidean", "asHomogeneous"))`: | convert between homogeneous and Euclidean coordinates when x, y and z are columns
`r indexfns(c("asEuclidean2", "asHomogeneous2"))`: | convert when x, y and z are rows
`r indexfns(c("rotate3d", "scale3d", "translate3d"))`:  | apply a transformation
`r indexfns("transform3d")`:  | apply a general transformation
`r indexfns(c("rotationMatrix", "scaleMatrix", "translationMatrix"))`:  | compute the transformation matrix
`r indexfns("identityMatrix")`: | return a 4 x 4 identity matrix
`r indexfns("projectDown")`: | a 3D to 2D projection down a vector

There is also a function `r indexfns("GramSchmidt")`, mainly for internal
use:  it does a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of a 3x3 matrix,
with some specializations for its use in `r linkfn("cylinder3d")`.

### Working with other packages

Sometimes it may be convenient to interactively
rotate a scene to a particular view, then 
display it in `lattice` or base graphics.
The `r indexfns("rglToLattice")` and `r indexfns("rglToBase")` functions support this.

For example, we first display the volcano data in `rgl`:
```{r echo = 2:3}
close3d()
persp3d(volcano, col = "green")
```
This display is interactive, but we can reproduce the initial view using the
`lattice` `r linkfn("wireframe", pkg = "lattice")` or base graphics `r linkfn("persp", pkg = "graphics")` functions:
```{r}
lattice::wireframe(volcano, col = "green", 
		   screen = rglToLattice())
angles <- rglToBase()
persp(volcano, col = "green", shade = TRUE,
      theta = angles$theta, phi = angles$phi)
```

Note that the `orientlib` package must be 
available for these functions to work.

### Creating `pkgdown` websites

The ["Using RGL in pkgdown web sites"](pkgdown.html) vignette
describes how to use `rgl` in a `pkgdown` web site.  The
utility function `r indexfns("in_pkgdown_example")` can be used
to detect that `pkgdown` is being used.

### Working with Javascript

The WebGL displays created using `r linkfn("rglwidget")`
rely on a large body of Javascript code included in this
package.  To help in development of this code, the
`r indexfns("makeDependency")` function was written.
It may be useful in other packages that include Javascript.

### Other functions

This section is for miscellaneous functions that don't
fall in any of the other categories in this document.

The `r indexfns("setGraphicsDelay")` function is designed
to work around what appears to be a bug on macOS:  if
a standard plot window is opened too quickly after an `rgl`
window, R can crash.  This function inserts a one second 
delay when it appears to be needed.

## Warning:  Work in Progress!

This vignette is always a work in progress.  Some aspects of the `rgl`
package are not described, or do not have examples.  There may
even be functions that are missed completely, if the following
list is not empty:
```{r echo=FALSE}
setdiff(ls("package:rgl"), documentedfns)
```

## Index of Functions

The following functions and constants are described in this document:<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
writeIndex(cols = if (knitr::is_html_output()) 5 else 4)
```
