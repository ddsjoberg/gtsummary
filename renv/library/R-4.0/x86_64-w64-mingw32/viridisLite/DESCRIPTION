Description: Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with 
    common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color 
    maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when 
    converted to black-and-white for printing. This is the 'lite' version of the 
    'viridis' package that also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and 
    continuous color and fill scales and can be found at 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis>.
