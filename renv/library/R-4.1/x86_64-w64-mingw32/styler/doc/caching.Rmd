This is a developer vignette to explain how caching works and what we learned on
the way. To use the caching feature, please have a look at the README.

The main caching features were implemented in the following two pull requests:

- #538: Implemented simple caching and utilities for managing caches. Input text
  is styled as a whole and added to the cache afterwards. This makes most sense
  given that the very same expression will probably never be passed to styler,
  unless it is already compliant with the style guide. Apart from the
  (negligible) innode, caching text has a memory cost of 0. Speed boosts only
  result if the whole text passed to styler is compliant to the style guide in
  use. Changing one line in a file with hundreds of lines means each line will
  be styled again. This is a major drawback and makes the cache only useful for
  a use with a pre-commit framework (the initial motivation) or when functions
  like `style_pkg()` are run often and most files were not changed.

- #578: Adds a second layer of caching by caching top-level expressions
  individually. This will bring speed boosts to the situation where very little
  is changed but there are many top-level expressions. Hence, changing one line
  in a big file will invalidate the cache for the expression the line is part
  of, i.e. when changing `x <- 2` to `x = 2` below, styler will have to restyle
  the function definition, but not `another(call)` and all other expressions
  that were not changed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
function() {
  # a comment 
  x = 2 # <- change this line
}

another(call)
```

While #538 also required a lot of thought, this is not necessarily visible in
the diff. The main challenge was to figure out how the caching should work
conceptually and where we best insert the functionality as well as how to make
caching work for edge cases like trailing blank lines etc. For details on the
conceptual side and requirements, see #538.

In comparison, the diff in #578 is much larger. We can walk through the main
changes introduced here:

- Each nest gained a column *is_cached* to indicate if an expression is cached.
  It's only ever set for the top-level nest, but set to `NA` for all other
  nests. Also, comments are not cached because they are essentially top level
  terminals which are very cheap to style (also because hardly any rule concerns
  them) and because each comment is a top-level expression, simply styling them
  is cheaper than checking for each of them if it is in the cache.

- Each nest also gained a column *block* to denote the block to which it belongs
  for styling. Running each top-level expression through
  `parse_transform_serialize_r()` separately is relatively expensive. We prefer
  to put multiple top-level expressions into a block and process the block. This
  is done with `parse_transform_serialize_r_block()`. Note that before we
  implemented this PR, all top-level expressions were sent through
  `parse_transform_serialize_r()` as one block. Leaving out some exceptions in
  this explanation, we always put uncached top-level expressions in a block and
  cached top-level expressions into a block and then style the uncached ones.

- Apart from the actual styling, a very costly part of formatting code with
  styler is to compute the nested parse data with `compute_parse_data_nested()`.
  When caching top-level expressions, it is evident that building up the nested
  structure for cached code is unnecessary because we don't actually style it,
  but simply return `text`. For this reason, we introduce the concept of a
  shallow nest. It can only occur at the top level. For the top-level
  expressions we know that they are cached, we remove all children before
  building up the nested parse table and let them act as `terminals` and will
  later simply return their `text`. Hence, in the nested parse table, no cached
  expressions have children.

- Because we now style blocks of expressions and we want to preserve the line
  breaks between them, we need to keep track of all blank lines between
  expressions, which was not necessary previously because all expressions were
  in a block and the blank lines separating them were stored in `newlines` and
  `lag_newlines` except for all blank lines before the first expression.

- Because we wanted to cache by expression, but process by block of expression,
  we needed to decompose the block into individual expressions and add them to
  the cache once we obtained the final text. We could probably also have added
  expressions to the cache before we put the text together, but the problem is
  that at some point we turn the nested structure into a flat structure and as
  this must happen with a `post_visit()` approach, we'd have to implement a
  complicated routine to check if we are now about to put together all top-level
  expressions and then if yes write them to the cache. A simple (but maybe not
  so elegant) parsing of the output as implemented in `cache_by_expression()`
  seemed reasonable in terms of limiting complexity and keeping efficiency.
