```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

styler functionality is available in other tools, most notably

* as a pre-commit hook `style-files` in
  <https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit>

* via `usethis::use_tidy_style()` styles your project according to the tidyverse
  style guide.

* through commenting a PR on GitHub with `\style` when the [GitHub
  Action](https://github.com/features/actions) [*Tidyverse
  CI*](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#tidyverse-ci-workflow)
  is used. The most convenient way to set this up is via
  [`usethis::use_tidy_github_actions()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/tidyverse.html).

* in `reprex::reprex(..., style = TRUE)` to prettify reprex code before
  printing. To permanently use `style = TRUE` without specifying it every time,
  you can add the following line to your `.Rprofile` (via
  `usethis::edit_r_profile()`): `options(reprex.styler = TRUE)`.

* as a formatter for RMarkdown without modifying the source. This feature is
  implemented as a code chunk option in knitr. use `tidy = "styler"` in the
  header of a code chunks (e.g.` ```{r name-of-the-chunk, tidy = "styler"} `),
  or `knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = "styler")` at the top of your RMarkdown
  script.

* As a fixer to the [ale
  Plug-in](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/pull/2401) for VIM.

* in the *format-all* command for Emacs in 
  [emacs-format-all-the-code](https://github.com/lassik/emacs-format-all-the-code).

* As a [Jupyterlab code
  formatter](https://jupyterlab-code-formatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#r-code-formatters).

* for pretty-printing [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow data
  frames with `drake::drake_plan_source()`.
