            "Before unlike after. Before:", paste(before, sep = "\n"),

This vignette shows how output from styler might differ when `strict = FALSE`. 
For brevity, we don't show the output of `strict = TRUE`, but it should be 
pretty simple for the user to derive it from the bullet point(s) or simply paste the 
code in the console to see the output.

```{r setup}
library(styler)
```

* multi-line function declarations without curly braces are tolerated.

```{styler}
function()
  NULL
```

* Spaces before opening parenthesis, tilde as well as around comments and math token must 
  be at least one, not exactly one.

```{styler}
1  +    (1 + 3)
1 ~  more()   #   comment
```
* More than one line break is tolerated before closing curly brace and line 
  breaks between curly and round braces are not removed. 
```{styler}
test({
  1

}
)
```

* Multi-line calls don't  put the closing brace on a new line nor trigger a line
  break after the opening brace.

```{styler}
call(
  this)
call(2,
  more
)
```

* No line break inserted after pipes nor ggplot2 or pipe expressions.

```{styler}
ggplot2::ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous()

this %>% is() %>% a() %>% long() %>% pipe()
```

* ifelse statements don't get curly braces added when multi-line.

```{styler}
if (TRUE) 3  else 
  5
```
