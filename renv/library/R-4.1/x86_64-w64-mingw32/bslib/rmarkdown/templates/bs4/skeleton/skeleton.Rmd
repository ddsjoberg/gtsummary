## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document themed with [`{bslib}` package](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/). `{bslib}` makes it easy to customize the main colors and fonts of a `html_document`, [`flexdashboard::flex_dashboard`](https://flexdashboard-pkg.netlify.app/articles/articles/theme.html), [shiny::fluidPage()](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/fluidPage.html), or more generally any website that uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. The `theme` parameter in the yaml front-matter of this Rmd document describes a [`bslib::bs_theme()`](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/reference/bs_theme.html) object, which provides access to 100s of [theming options](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs4-variables.html) (via its `...` argument) in addition to the main options demonstrated here (e.g., `bg`, `fg`, `primary`, etc).

This particular example uses `{bslib}`'s default Bootstrap version (which is Bootstrap 4 at the time of writing). If your document has any of the following, you should probably "pin" the Bootstrap version (e.g., add `version: 4` to the `theme` definition):

1. A `theme` which uses the `...` of `bs_theme()` (i.e., pretty much any of these [theming options](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs4-variables.html) that aren't a named `bs_theme()` argument).
2. Custom HTML or CSS that uses Bootstrap-specific features (e.g., [utility classes](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/theming.html#utility-classes-1))

## Themed Plots {.tabset .tabset-pills}

When running this document with [`{thematic}`](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/) installed, the `thematic::thematic_rmd(font = "auto")` effectively translates `theme` (CSS) settings to new global theming defaults for `{ggplot2}`, `{lattice}`, and `{base}` R graphics:

### ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

### lattice

```{r}
lattice::show.settings()
```

### base

```{r}
plot(pressure, col = thematic::thematic_get_option("accent"))
```
