This vignette explains the rational behind the `demean()` function. 

We give recommendations how to analyze multilevel or hierarchical data
structures, when macro-indicators (or level-2 predictors, or higher-level units,
or more general: _group-level predictors_) are used as covariates and the model
suffers from **heterogeneity bias** [@bell_explaining_2015].

# Sample data used in this vignette

```{r}
library(parameters)
data("qol_cancer")
```

* Variables:

  * `QoL` : Response (quality of life of patient)

  * `phq4` : Patient Health Questionnaire, **time-varying** variable

  * `hospital` : Location of treatment, **time-invariant** variable, co-variate

  * `education`: Educational level, **time-invariant** variable, co-variate

  * `ID` : patient ID

  * `time` : time-point of measurement

# Heterogeneity bias

Heterogeneity bias occurs when group-level predictors vary within and across
groups, and hence fixed effects may correlate with group (or random) effects.
This is a typical situation when analyzing longitudinal or panel data: Due to
the repeated measurements of persons, the "person" (or subject-ID) is now a
level-2 variable. Predictors at level-1 ("fixed effects"), e.g. self-rated
health or income, now have an effect at level-1 ("within"-effect) and at
higher-level units (level-2, the subject-level, which is the "between"-effect)
(see also [this posting](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.app/posts/2019-10-21-accounting-for-within-and-between-subject-effect/)).
This inevitably leads to correlating fixed effects and error terms - which, in
turn, results in biased estimates, because both the within- *and* between-effect
are captured in *one* estimate.

You can check if your model may suffer from heterogeneity bias using the
`check_heterogeneity_bias()` function:

```{r}
check_heterogeneity_bias(qol_cancer, select = c("phq4", "education"), group = "ID")
```

# Adressing heterogeneity bias: the Fixed Effects Regression (FE) approach

Fixed effects regression models (FE) are a popular approach for panel data
analysis in particular in econometrics and considered as gold standard. To avoid
the problem of heterogeneity bias, in FE all higher-level variance (and thus,
any between-effects), "are controlled out using the higher-level entities
themselves, included in the model as dummy variables" [@bell_explaining_2015].
As a consequence, FE models are only able estimate _within-effects_.

To remove between-effects and only model within-effects, the data needs some
preparation: _de-meaning_. De-meaning, or _person-mean centering_, or _centering
within clusters_, takes away the higher-level mean from the regression equation,
and as such, FE avoids estimating a parameter for each higher-level unit.

## Computing the de-meaned and group-meaned variables

```{r}
qol_cancer <- cbind(
  qol_cancer,
  datawizard::demean(qol_cancer, select = c("phq4", "QoL"), group = "ID")
)
```

Now we have:

  * `phq4_between`: time-varying variable with the mean of `phq4` across all
    time-points, for each patient (ID).

  * `phq4_within`: the de-meaned time-varying variable `phq4`.

A FE model is a classical linear model, where

 * Intercept is removed

  * time-invariant predictors are not allowed to be included

  * the group-level factor is included as predictor

  * time-varying predictors are de-meaned ("person-mean centered", indicating
    the "within-subject" effect)

```{r}
fe_model1 <- lm(
  QoL ~ 0 + time + phq4_within + ID,
  data = qol_cancer
)
# we use only the first two rows, because the remaining rows are
# the estimates for "ID", which is not of interest here...
model_parameters(fe_model1)[1:2, ]


# instead of removing the intercept, we could also use the
# de-meaned response...
fe_model2 <- lm(
  QoL_within ~ time + phq4_within + ID,
  data = qol_cancer
)
model_parameters(fe_model2)[2:3, ]

# we compare the results with those from the "lfe"-package for panel data
library(lfe)
fe_model3 <- felm(
  QoL ~ time + phq4 | ID,
   data = qol_cancer
)
model_parameters(fe_model3)
```

As we can see, the _within-effect_ of PHQ-4 is `-3.66`, hence the mean of the
change for an average individual case in our sample (or, the "net" effect), is
`-3.66`.

But what about the between-effect? How do people with higher PHQ-4 score differ
from people with lower PHQ-4 score? Or what about educational inequalities? Do
higher educated people have a higher PHQ-4 score than lower educated people?

This question cannot be answered with FE regression. But: "Can one fit a
multilevel model with varying intercepts (or coefficients) when the units and
predictors correlate? The answer is yes. And the solution is simple."
[@bafumi_fitting_2006]

# Adressing heterogeneity bias: the Mixed Model approach

Mixed models include different levels of sources of variability (i.e. error
terms at each level). Predictors used at level-1 that are varying across
higher-level units will thus have residual errors at both level-1 and
higher-level units. "Such covariates contain two parts: one that is specific to
the higher-level entity that does not vary between occasions, and one that
represents the difference between occasions, within higher-level entities"
[@bell_explaining_2015]. Hence, the error terms will be correlated with the
covariate, which violates one of the assumptions of mixed models (iid,
independent and identically distributed error terms) - also known and described
above as _heterogeneity bias_.

But how can this issue be addressed outside the FE framework?

There are several ways how to address this using a mixed models approach:

  * Correlated group factors and predictors are no problem anyway, because
    [partial
    pooling](https://www.tjmahr.com/plotting-partial-pooling-in-mixed-effects-models/)
    allows estimates of units o borrow strength from the whole sample and shrink
    toward a common mean (@shor_bayesian_2007).

  * If predictor and group factors correlate, one can remove this correlation by
    group-meaning [or "mean within clusters", @bafumi_fitting_2006;
    @gelman_data_2007, Chap. 12.6.].

  * When time-varying predictors are "decomposed" into their time-varying and
    time-invariant components (demeaning), then mixed models can model **both**
    within- and between-subject effects [@bell_fixed_2019] - this approach is
    essentially a further development of a long-known recommendation by Mundlak
    [@mundlak_pooling_1978].

For now, we will follow the last recommendation and use the within- and
between-version of `phq4`.

```{r}
library(lme4)
mixed_1 <- lmer(
  QoL ~ time + phq4_within + phq4_between + (1 | ID),
  data = qol_cancer
)
model_parameters(mixed_1)

# compare to FE-model
model_parameters(fe_model1)[1:2, ]
```

As we can see, the estimates and standard errors are identical. The argument
_against_ the use of mixed models, i.e. that using mixed models for panel data
will yield biased estimates and standard errors, is based on an incorrect model
specification [@mundlak_pooling_1978]. As such, when the (mixed) model is
properly specified, the estimator of the mixed model is identical to the
'within' (i.e. FE) estimator.

As a consequence, we cannot only use the above specified mixed model for panel
data, we can even specify more complex models including within-effects,
between-effects or random effects variation. A mixed models approach can model
the causes of endogeneity explicitly by including the (separated) within- and
between-effects of time-varying fixed effects and including time-constant fixed
effects.

```{r}
mixed_2 <- lmer(
  QoL ~ time + phq4_within + phq4_between + education + (1 + time | ID),
  data = qol_cancer
)
# effects = "fixed" will not display random effects, but split the
# fixed effects into its between- and within-effects components.
model_parameters(mixed_2, effects = "fixed")
```

For more complex models, within-effects will naturally change slightly and are
no longer identical to simpler FE models. This is no "bias", but rather the
result of building more complex models: FE models lack information of variation
in the group-effects or between-subject effects. Furthermore, FE models cannot
include random slopes, which means that fixed effects regressions are neglecting
"cross-cluster differences in the effects of lower-level controls (which)
reduces the precision of estimated context effects, resulting in (...) low
statistical power" [@heisig_costs_2017].

# Conclusion: Complex Random Effects Within-Between Models

Depending on the structure of the data, the best approach to analyzing panel
data would be a so called "complex random effects within-between" model
[@bell_fixed_2019]:

```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- "y<sub>it</sub> = &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1W</sub> (x<sub>it</sub> - &#x035E;x<sub>i</sub>) + &beta;<sub>2B</sub> &#x035E;x<sub>i</sub> + &beta;<sub>3</sub> z<sub>i</sub> + &upsilon;<sub>i0</sub> + &upsilon;<sub>i1</sub> (x<sub>it</sub> - &#x035E;x<sub>i</sub>) + &epsilon;<sub>it</sub>"
knitr::asis_output(f)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
f <- "<ul><li>x<sub>it</sub> - &#x035E;x<sub>i</sub> is the de-meaned predictor, <em>phq4_within</em></li><li>&#x035E;x<sub>i</sub> is the group-meaned predictor, <em>phq4_between</em></li><li>&beta;<sub>1W</sub> is the coefficient for phq4_within (within-subject)</li><li>&beta;<sub>2B</sub> is the coefficient for phq4_between (bewteen-subject)</li><li>&beta;<sub>3</sub> is the coefficient for time-constant predictors, such as `hospital` or `education` (bewteen-subject)</li></ul>"
knitr::asis_output(f)
```

In R-code, the model is written down like this:

```{r}
rewb <- lmer(
  QoL ~ time + phq4_within + phq4_between + education +
    (1 + time | ID) + (1 + phq4_within | ID),
  data = qol_cancer
)
```

**What about time-constant predictors?**

After demeaning time-varying predictors, "at the higher level, the mean term is
no longer constrained by Level 1 effects, so it is free to account for all the
higher-level variance associated with that variable" [@bell_explaining_2015].

Thus, _time-constant **categorical**_ predictors, that only have a
between-effect, can be simply included as fixed effects predictor (since they’re
not constrained by level-1 effects). Time-constant _continuous_ **group-level
predictors** (for instance, GDP of countries) should be group-meaned, to have a
proper "between"-effect [@gelman_data_2007, Chap. 12.6.].

The benefit of this kind of model is that you have information on within-,
between- and other time-constant (i.e. between) effects or group-level
predictors...

```{r}
model_parameters(rewb, effects = "fixed")
```

... but you can also model the variation of (group) effects across time (and
probably space), and you can even include more higher-level units (e.g. nested
design or cross-classified design with more than two levels):

```{r}
random_parameters(rewb)
```

**What about imbalanced groups, i.e. large differences in N per group?**

See little example after this visual example...

# A visual example

First, we generate some fake data that implies a linear relationship between
outcome and independent variable. The objective is that the amount of typing
errors depends on how fast (typing speed) you can type, however, the more typing
experience you have, the faster you can type. Thus, the outcome measure is
"amount of typing errors", while our predictor is "typing speed". Furthermore,
we have repeated measurements of people with different "typing experience
levels".

The results show that we will have two sources of variation: Overall, more
experienced typists make less mistakes (group-level pattern). When typing
faster, typists make more mistakes (individual-level pattern).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(see)

set.seed(123)
n <- 5
b <- seq(1, 1.5, length.out = 5)
x <- seq(2, 2 * n, 2)

d <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:n, function(i) {
  data.frame(
    x = seq(1, n, by = .2),
    y = 2 * x[i] + b[i] * seq(1, n, by = .2) + rnorm(21),
    grp = as.factor(2 * i)
  )
}))

d <- d %>%
  group_by(grp) %>%
  mutate(x = rev(15 - (x + 1.5 * as.numeric(grp)))) %>%
  ungroup()

labs <- c("very slow", "slow", "average", "fast", "very fast")
levels(d$grp) <- rev(labs)

d <- cbind(d, datawizard::demean(d, c("x", "y"), group = "grp"))
```

Let's look at the raw data...

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(colour = "#555555", size = 2.5, alpha = .5) +
  see::theme_modern() +
  labs(x = "Typing Speed", y = "Typing Errors", colour = "Type Experience")
```

## Model 1: Linear relationship between typing errors and typing speed

We can now assume a (linear) relationship between typing errors and typing
speed.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(colour = "#555555", size = 2.5, alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, colour = "#555555") +
  see::theme_modern() +
  labs(x = "Typing Speed", y = "Typing Errors", colour = "Type Experience")
```

Looking at the coefficients, we have following model with a coefficient of
`-1.92`.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = d)
model_parameters(m1)
```

However, we have ignored the clustered structure in our data, in this example
due to repeated measurements.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = grp), size = 2.5, alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, colour = "#555555") +
  see::scale_color_flat() +
  see::theme_modern() +
  labs(x = "Typing Speed", y = "Typing Errors", colour = "Type Experience")
```

## Model 2: Within-subject effect of typing speed

A fixed effects regression (FE-regression) would now remove all between-effects
and include only the within-effects as well as the group-level indicator.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(colour = grp), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = grp), size = 2.2, alpha = .6) +
  see::scale_color_flat() +
  see::theme_modern() +
  labs(x = "Typing Speed", y = "Typing Errors", colour = "Type Experience")
```

This returns the coefficient of the "within"-effect, which is `1.2`, with a
standard error of `0.07`. Note that the FE-model does *not* take the variation
*between* subjects into account, thus resulting in (possibly) biased estimates,
and biased standard errors.

```{r}
m2 <- lm(y ~ 0 + x_within + grp, data = d)
model_parameters(m2)[1, ]
```

## Model 3: Between-subject effect of typing speed

To understand, why the above model 1 (`m1`) returns a biased estimate, which is
a "weighted average" of the within- and between-effects, let us look at the
between-effect now.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = grp), size = 2.2, alpha = .6) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = x_between, y = y_between), method = "lm", se = F, colour = "#444444") +
  see::scale_color_flat() +
  see::theme_modern() +
  labs(x = "Typing Speed", y = "Typing Errors", colour = "Type Experience")
```

As we can see, the between-effect is `-2.93`, which is different from the
`-1.92` estimated in the model `m1`.

```{r}
m3 <- lm(y ~ x_between, data = d)
model_parameters(m3)
```

## Model 4: Mixed model with within- and between-subjects

Since FE-models can only model within-effects, we now use a mixed model with
within- and between-effects.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(colour = grp), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = grp), size = 2.2, alpha = .6) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = x_between, y = y_between), method = "lm", se = F, colour = "#444444") +
  see::scale_color_flat() +
  see::theme_modern() +
  labs(x = "Typing Speed", y = "Typing Errors", colour = "Type Experience")
```

We see, the estimate for the within-effects is *not* biased. Furthermore, we get
the correct between-effect as well (standard errors differ, because the variance
in the grouping structure is more accurately taken into account).

```{r}
m4 <- lmer(y ~ x_between + x_within + (1 | grp), data = d)
model_parameters(m4)
```

## Model 5: Complex Random-Effects Within-Between Model

Finally, we can also take the variation between subjects into account by adding
a random slope. This model can be called a complex "REWB" (random-effects
within-between) model. Due to the variation between subjects, we get larger
standard errors for the within-effect.

```{r}
m5 <- lmer(y ~ x_between + x_within + (1 + x_within | grp), data = d)
model_parameters(m5)
```

# Balanced versus imbalanced groups

The "simple" linear slope of the between-effect (and also from the
within-effect) is (almost) identical in "classical" linear regression compared
to linear mixed models when the groups are balanced, i.e. when the number of
observation per group is similar or the same.

Whenever group size is imbalanced, the "simple" linear slope will be adjusted.
This leads to different estimates for between-effects between classical and
mixed models regressions due to shrinkage - i.e. for larger variation of group
sizes we find stronger regularization of estimates.

Hence, for mixed models with larger differences in number of observation per
random effects group, the between-effect will differ from the between-effect
calculated by "classical" regression models. However, this shrinkage is a
desired property of mixed models and usually improves the estimates.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 5
b <- seq(1, 1.5, length.out = 5)
x <- seq(2, 2 * n, 2)

d <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:n, function(i) {
  data.frame(
    x = seq(1, n, by = .2),
    y = 2 * x[i] + b[i] * seq(1, n, by = .2) + rnorm(21),
    grp = as.factor(2 * i)
  )
}))

# create imbalanced groups
d$grp[sample(which(d$grp == 8), 10)] <- 6
d$grp[sample(which(d$grp == 4), 8)] <- 2
d$grp[sample(which(d$grp == 10), 9)] <- 6

d <- d %>%
  group_by(grp) %>%
  mutate(x = rev(15 - (x + 1.5 * as.numeric(grp)))) %>%
  ungroup()

labs <- c("very slow", "slow", "average", "fast", "very fast")
levels(d$grp) <- rev(labs)

d <- cbind(d, datawizard::demean(d, c("x", "y"), group = "grp"))

# Between-subject effect of typing speed
m1 <- lm(y ~ x_between, data = d)
model_parameters(m1)

# Between-subject effect of typing speed, accounting for group structure
m2 <- lmer(y ~ x_between + (1 | grp), data = d)
model_parameters(m2)
```
