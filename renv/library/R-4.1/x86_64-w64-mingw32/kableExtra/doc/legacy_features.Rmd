This document includes documentations for legacy/unrecommended features in this package. 

Unless there are significant differences between HTML/LaTeX, I will only keep one copy of documentation in HTML here since most of the functions in this packages share a very similar interface between their HTML and LaTeX ends. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
dt <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
```

# Unrecommended Features

## add_footnote
As the first function written in this package, the design of the `add_footnote` function is not flexible enough to introduce new features to this function. So I redesigned the footnote part and created the `footnote()` function. `add_footnote` will still be there for a while and be maintained because of its unique feature to add page footnote to longtables. 

Here are the old documentation for `add_footnote`.

### Notation systems
You can also use `add_footnote()` function from this package. You will need to supply a character vector with each element as one footnote. You may select from `number`, `alphabet` and `symbol` for different types of notations. Example are listed below.

#### Alphabet
```{r}
kable(dt, "html") %>%
  kable_styling("striped") %>%
  add_footnote(c("Footnote 1", "Have a good day."), notation = "alphabet")
```

#### Number
```{r}
kable(dt, "html") %>%
  kable_styling("striped") %>%
  add_footnote(c("Footnote 1", "Have a good day."), notation = "number")
```

#### Symbol
```{r}
kable(dt, "html") %>%
  kable_styling("striped") %>%
  add_footnote(c("Footnote 1", "Footnote 2", "Footnote 3"), notation = "symbol")
```

### In-table markers
By design, `add_footnote()` will transform any `[note]` to in-table footnote markers. 

```{r}
kable(dt, "html", caption = "Demo Table[note]") %>%
  kable_styling("striped") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ", "Group 1[note]" = 3, "Group 2[note]" = 3)) %>%
  add_footnote(c("This table is from mtcars", 
                 "Group 1 contains mpg, cyl and disp", 
                 "Group 2 contains hp, drat and wt"), 
               notation = "symbol")
```
