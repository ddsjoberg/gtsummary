Workflows encompasses the three main stages of the modeling _process_: pre-processing of data, model fitting, and post-processing of results. This page enumerates the possible operations for each stage that have been implemented to date.

## Pre-processing

The two elements allowed for pre-processing are:

 * A standard [model formula](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Formulae-for-statistical-models) via `add_formula()`.
 
 * A recipe object via `add_recipe()`.
 
You can use one or the other but not both.

## Model Fitting

`parsnip` model specifications are the only option here, specified via `add_model()`.

When using a preprocessor, you may need an additional formula for special model terms (e.g. for mixed models or generalized linear models). In these cases, specify that formula using `add_model()`'s `formula` argument, which will be passed to the underlying model when `fit()` is called.

## Post-processing

Some examples of post-processing the model predictions would be: adding a probability threshold for two-class problems, calibration of probability estimates, truncating the possible range of predictions, and so on.

None of these are currently implemented but will be in coming versions.
