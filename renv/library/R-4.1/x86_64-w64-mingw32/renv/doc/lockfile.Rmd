`renv` uses a **lockfile** to capture the state of your \R library at some point
in time. It is stored as a collection of *records*, with different records
defining:

- The version of `renv` used when generating the lockfile;
- The version of `R` used in that project;
- The R repositories that were active when the lockfile was created;
- *Package records* defining each R package, their version, and their
  installation source.

Here is an example lockfile, including the packages `markdown` and `mime`:

```
{
  "R": {
    "Version": "`r getRversion()`",
    "Repositories": [
      {
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cloud.r-project.org"
      }
    ]
  },
  "Packages": {
    "markdown": {
      "Package": "markdown",
      "Version": "1.0",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "4584a57f565dd7987d59dda3a02cfb41"
    },
    "mime": {
      "Package": "mime",
      "Version": "0.7",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "908d95ccbfd1dd274073ef07a7c93934"
    }
  }
}
```

The function `renv::snapshot()` is used to create this lockfile, and by default
writes these records to the file `renv.lock`. Later, if you need to reinstall
the specific package versions as recorded in `renv.lock`, you can use
`renv::restore()`.
