  o plot.effect modified was modified so that it can plot on the scale of the "link" function but label axes on the scale of the response. See ?plot.effect for details.

Changes to Version 1.0-4

  o Modified box.cox.powers to accept hypotheses to be tested.

  o Removed effect-display functions (to effects package).

  o Added warnings to Anova methods for F-tests in binomial and Poisson GLMs that the dispersion is estimated rather than taken as 1.

Changes to Version 1.0-5

  o Small changes to scatterplot and scatterplot.matrix to avoid "condition has length > 1" warnings.

Changes to Version 1.0-6

  o Print method for outlier.test no longer prints NA for Bonferroni p-values > 1; prints "> 1".

Changes to Version 1.0-7

  o More small changes to scatterplot to avoid "condition has length > 1" warnings.

Changes to Version 1.0-8

  o Small correction to documentation for recode.

  o Restored missing States data frame.

  o Small documentation changes to pass new package checks.

Changes to Version 1.0-9

Changes to Version 1.0-10

  o scatterplot.formula made compatible with na.action=na.exclude.

  o Documentation corrections to satisfy package checks in R 1.9.0 (devel).

  o Fixed bug in ceres.plot.lm that caused an error when the subset argument was used to exclude observations in fitting the model.

  o Changed ncv.test to allow weighted lm object (suggested by Sandy Weisberg).

  o scatterplot.matrix now passes ... argument to pairs (also suggested by Sandy Weisberg).

Changes to Version 1.0-13

  o Small changes to levene.test and box.cox.powers to make output compatible with version 0.9-10 of the Rcmdr package.

Changes to Version 1.0-14

  o cr.plots() ignored its span argument when variable was specified in the call (thanks to Christophe Pallier for pointing this out).

  o Added some(), which prints a few randomly selected elements (or rows) of an object.

  o Added Anova() methods for multinomial logistic regression [via multinom() in the nnet package], and for proportional-odds logistic regression [via polr() in the MASS package).

  o Made influence.plot() generic, with a method for lm objects that handles glm objects as well.

Changes to Version 1.0-15

  o Changed recode() to accommodate factor levels with spaces (suggested by Dan Putler).

  o Added cex* arguments to scatterplot() and scatterplot.matrix(), and a jitter argument to scatterplot (suggested by CG Pettersson).

  o Added symbox() function for selecting a transformation to symmetry (a modified version of a function contributed by Gregor Gorjanc).

  o ncv.test() modified so that it doesn't fail when the variance formula has a different pattern of NAs than the model formula (adapting a suggestion by Achim Zeileis).

  o Added argument to spread.level.plot.default() to optionally suppress point labels (suggested by Josyf Mychaleckyj).

  o vif() modified by Henric Nilsson to be applicable to generalized linear models and other models inheriting from class lm. Weighted linear models are now allowed.

Changes to Version 1.0-16

  o Modified to linear.hypothesis by Achim Zeleis to support alternative coefficient covariance-matrix estimators for linear models (via new vcov argument); to provide both chisquare and F tests for both linear and generalized-linear models (via new test argument); and to produce neater output (from both .lm and .glm methods).

  o Anova methods modified to work with new linear.hypothesis functions.

Changes to Version 1.0-17

  o Fixed a bug in scatterplot() that caused marginal boxplots to be incorrect when xlim or ylim arguments are supplied (pointed out by Erich Neuwirth).

Changes to Version 1.0-18

  o Restored print.chisq.test(), used by ncv.test() (which had been removed when linear.hypothesis was changed).

  o Fixed bug in recode() that could cause values with mixed letters and numbers to be treated incorrectly (reported by David Dailey and Tom Mulholland).

Changes to Version 1.0-19

  o Fix to linear.hypothesis.lm and linear.hypothesis.glm, which were printing long formulas awkwardly (thanks to Henric Nilsson).

Changes to Version 1.0-20

  o Major reworking of linear.hypothesis (mostly due to Achim Zeleis) (1) to allow symbollic specification of the hypothesis, and (2) to provide a default method that is applicable to any model for which coef and vcov methods exist (or, in the latter case, for which a coefficient-covariance matrix is supplied).

  o The car package now has a namespace.

  o Fixes to Anova.multinom and Anova.polr reflecting changes to multinom and polr (thanks Huaibao Feng for a bug report).

  o Added cex argument to qq.plot methods, suggested by Peter Ehlers.

  o Modified box.cox so that the power argument can be a vector, returning a matrix of transformed values, adapting code contributed by Spencer Graves (but implementing different behaviour than the one suggested by Spencer).

  o Added identity.cex and identify.col arguments to influence.plot, as suggested by John Wilkinson.

  o Data sets are now provided as lazy data; Rd files updated to remove references to data() in examples.

  o Small modifications to documentation.

Changes to Version 1.1-0

  o  New version of linear.hypothesis (mostly due to Achim Zeleis); some changes to other functions as a consequence.

Changes to Version 1.1-1

  o  Small changes to scatterplot.matrix, adapting contribution of Richard Heiberger.

  o  scatterplot now places the legend in the top margin rather than positioning it interactively.

  o  Cleaned up links to help files in standard packages.

Changes to Version 1.1-2

  o  Fixed small bug in linear.hypothesis() that caused the RHS to printed with NAs in some circumstances.

Changes to Version 1.2-0

  o  vif now reports a more understandable error message when a coefficient in the model is aliased (thanks to a question posed by Ulrike Gr?mping).

  o  recode now takes a levels argument (as suggested by Adrian Dusa).

  o  Corrected diagonal panel functions local to scatterplot.matrix.default, which omitted ... argument (pointed out by Kurt Hornik and Brian Ripley).

  o  New methods for multivariate-linear models (mlm objects) for linear.hypothesis and Anova. Added OBrienKaiser data set for examples.

Changes to Version 1.2-1

  o  The name of the function influence.plot was changed to influencePlot to avoid confusion with the influence generic in the stats package.

Changes to Version 1.2-2

  o  Bug fixed in the bc function (reported by Henric Nilsson).

  o  Error in Bfox data set is now pointed out.

  o  levene.test now checks that second argument is a factor.

  o  Removed extended=FALSE argument to gsub() in some internal functions, since this argument is ignored when fixed=TRUE and generates a warning in R 2.6.0 (reported by Arne Henningsen).

Changes to Version 1.2-3

  o  Replaced obsolete \non_function{} markup in Rd files (reported by Kurt Hornik).

Changes to Version 1.2-4

  o  Avoid warnings in linear.hypothesis() produced by unnecessary use of extended = FALSE argument to strsplit() (problem reported by Alejandro Collantes Ch?vez-Costa).

Changes to Version 1.2-5

  o  Fixed small bug in reg.line() (pointed out by Kurt Hornik).

Changes to Version 1.2-5

  o  Improvements to linear.hypothesis.mlm() and Anova.mlm(), e.g., to detect deficient-rank error SSP matrices (as suggested by Ralf Goertz).

  o  For models with only an intercept, Anova() with type="II" now substitutes equivalent type="III" tests (since the code for type="II" doesn't handle intercepts). This is especially useful for repeated-measures designs with only within-subjects factors (in response to a problem reported by Ralf Goertz).

Changes to Version 1.2-7

  o  Added Mauchly tests for sphericity in repeated-measures designs to summary.Anova.mlm() (suggested by Ralf Goertz).

Changes to Version 1.2-8

  o  HF eps > 1 is now set to 1 in adjusting df in summary.Anova.mlm(), consistent with the behaviour of anova.mlm() (suggested by Ralf Goertz).

  o  Fixed bug in summary.Anova.mlm() that surfaced when all univariate repeated-measures tests have 1 df and hence GG and HF corrections don't apply to any of the tests (reported by Ralf Goertz).

  o  levene.test() is now generic, contributed by  Derek Ogle.

  o  Small changes.

Changes to Version 1.2-9

	o  Fixed bug in scatterplot() that left room for a legend even when legend.plot=FALSE (reported by David Carlson).

	o  Allowed colours in col argument to scatterplot() to recycle (suggested by David Carlson).

	o  verbose=TRUE in linear.hypothesis() now prints (in addition to previous output) the estimated value of the hypothesis (Oleksandr Perekhozhuk).
