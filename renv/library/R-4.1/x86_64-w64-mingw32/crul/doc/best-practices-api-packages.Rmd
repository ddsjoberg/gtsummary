The `crul` package documentation mostly documents how to work
with any particular function or class, but does not detail 
how you would use the package in a more realistic context. This
vignette outlines what we think of as best practices for using
`crul` in scripts or an R package.

## Importing crul

In most cases you'll only need to import one thing from `crul`: 
`HttpClient`. Add crul to `Imports` in your `DESCRIPTION` file,
and ad an entry like `@importFrom crul HttpClient` somewhere in 
your package documentation, for example:

```r
#' Some function
#' 
#' @export
#' @importFrom crul HttpClient
#' ...
```

## HTTP request function

If you have more than one function that needs to make an HTTP request
it's probably useful to have a function for doing HTTP requests. The
following is an example of a function.


```r
xGET <- function(url, path, args = list(), ...) {
  cli <- crul::HttpClient$new(url, opts = list(...))
  res <- cli$get(path = path, query = args)
  res$raise_for_status()
  res$raise_for_ct_json()
  res$parse("UTF-8")
}
```

There's some features to note in the above function:

* `url`: this really depends on your setup. In some cases the base URL 
doesn't change, so you can remove the `url` parameter and define the 
url in the `crul::HttpClient$new()` call. 
* `path`: this likely will hold anything after the base path
* `args`: named list of query arguments. the default of `list()` 
means you can then use the function and not have to pass `args` 
in cases where no query args are needed.
* `...`: it's called an ellipsis. see example and discussion below.

You can use the function like:


```r
x <- xGET("https://httpbin.org", "get", args = list(foo = "bar"))
# parse the JSON to a list
jsonlite::fromJSON(x)
# more parsing
```

Because we used an ellipsis, anyone can pass in curl options like:


```r
xGET("https://xxx.org", args = list(foo = "bar"), verbose = TRUE)
```

Curl options are important for digging into the details of HTTP 
requests, and go a long way towards users being able to sort out 
their own problems, and help you diagnose problems as well.

Alternatively, you can just do the HTTP request in your `xGET` function
and return the response object - and line by line, or with 
another function, parse results as needed.

## Failing with fauxpas

[fauxpas][] is in Suggests in this package. If you don't have it
installed, no worries, but if you do have it installed, we use
fauxpas.

There is not much difference with the default `raise_for_status()`
between using fauxpas and not using it. 

However, you can construct your own replacement with fauxpas that 
gives you more flexibility in how you deal with HTTP status codes.

First, make an HTTP request:


```r
con <- HttpClient$new("https://httpbin.org/status/404")
res <- con$get()
```

Then use `fauxpas::find_error_class` to get the correct R6 error 
class for the status code, in this case `404`


```r
x <- fauxpas::find_error_class(res$status_code)$new()
#> <HTTPNotFound>
#>  behavior: stop
#>  message_template: {{reason}} (HTTP {{status}})
#>  message_template_verbose: {{reason}} (HTTP {{status}}).\n - {{message}}
```

We can then do one of two things: use `$do()` or `$do_verbose()`. `$do()` 
is simpler and gives you thhe same thing `$raise_for_status()` gives, but
allows you to change behavior (stop vs. warning vs. message), and how the 
message is formatted. By default we get:


```r
x$do(res)
#> Error: Not Found (HTTP 404)
```

We can change the template using `whisker` templating


```r
x$do(res, template = "{{status}}\n  --> {{reason}}")
#> Error: 404
#>  --> Not Found
```

`$do_verbose()` gives you a lot more detail about the status code, possibly more
than you want:


```r
x$do_verbose(res)
#> Error: Not Found (HTTP 404).
#>  - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication
#>  is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone)
#>  status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable
#>  mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding
#>  address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to
#>  reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response
#> is applicable.
```

You can change behavior to either `warning` or `message`:


```r
x$behavior <- "warning"
x$do(res)
#> Warning message:
#> Not Found (HTTP 404)
x$behavior <- "message"
x$do(res)
#> Not Found (HTTP 404)
```

## Retrying requests

In some failure scenarios it may make sense to retry the same request. 
For example, if a 429 "Too many requests" http status is returned, you
can retry the request after a certain amount of time (that time should
be supplied by the server). We suggest using RETRY if you are in these
scenarios. See [`HttpClient$retry()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/crul/reference/HttpClient.html#method-retry)
for more information.


## Mocking with webmockr

[webmockr][] is a package for stubbing and setting expectations on 
HTTP requests. It has support for working with two HTTP request 
packages: [crul][] and [httr][]. 

There are a variety of use cases for `webmockr`. 

* Use it in an interactive R session where you're working 
on a project and want to mock HTTP requests and set certain responses. 
* You can be on a plane and still allow requests to work without an 
internet connection by setting a response to give back. 
* Test hard to test scenarios in your code or package. `webmockr` 
allows you to give back exact responses just as you describe and 
even fail with certain HTTP conditions. Getting certain failures 
to happen with a remote server can sometimes be difficult. 
* Package test suite: you can use `webmockr` in a test suite, 
although the next section covers `vcr` which builds on top of 
`webmockr` and is ideal for tests.

See the book [HTTP mocking and testing in R][book] for more.


## Testing with vcr

[vcr][] records and replays HTTP requests. Its main use case is for 
caching HTTP requests in test suites in R packages. It has support 
for working with two HTTP request packages: [crul][] and [httr][]. 

To use `vcr` for testing the setup is pretty easy. 

1. Add `vcr` to Suggests in your DESCRIPTION file
2. Make a file in your `tests/testthat/` directory called 
`helper-yourpackage.R` (or skip if as similar file already exists). 
In that file use the following lines to setup your path for storing 
cassettes (change path to whatever you want):

```r
library("vcr")
invisible(vcr::vcr_configure())
```

3. In your tests, for whichever tests you want to use `vcr`, wrap 
the tests in a `vcr::use_cassette()` call like:

```r
library(testthat)
test_that("my test", {
  vcr::use_cassette("rl_citation", {
    aa <- rl_citation()

    expect_is(aa, "character")
    expect_match(aa, "IUCN")
    expect_match(aa, "www.iucnredlist.org")
  })
})
```

That's it! Just run your tests are you normally would and any HTTP 
requests done by `crul` or `httr` will be cached on the first test run
then the cached responses used every time thereafter. 

See the book [HTTP mocking and testing in R][book] for more.

## What else?

Let us know if there's anything else you'd like to see in this 
document and/or if there's anything that can be explained better.

Last, the httr package has a similar article on best practices, see
