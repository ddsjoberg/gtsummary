## The difference between a dataframe and its render

Most of objects encountered throughout the **easystats** packages are "tables", i.e., a 2D matrix with columns and rows. In R, these objects are often, at their core, *data frames*. Let's create one to use as an example:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(insight)
library(dplyr)

df <- data.frame(
  Variable = c(1, 3, 5, 3, 1),
  Group = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B"),
  CI = c(0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 0.95),
  CI_low = c(3.35, 2.425, 6.213, 12.1, 1.23),
  CI_high = c(4.23, 5.31, 7.123, 13.5, 3.61),
  p = c(0.001, 0.0456, 0.45, 0.0042, 0.34)
)

df
```

When I display in in the console (calling an object - e.g. `df` - is actually equivalent to calling `print(df)`), the output looks alright, but it could be improved. Some packages, such as **knitr**, have functions to create a nicer output. For instance, in markdown, so that it can be nicely rendered in markdown documents when copied:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::kable(df, format = "markdown")

```
```
| Variable|Group |   CI| CI_low| CI_high|      p|
|--------:|:-----|----:|------:|-------:|------:|
|        1|A     | 0.95|  3.350|   4.230| 0.0010|
|        3|A     | 0.95|  2.425|   5.310| 0.0456|
|        5|A     | 0.95|  6.213|   7.123| 0.4500|
|        3|B     | 0.95| 12.100|  13.500| 0.0042|
|        1|B     | 0.95|  1.230|   3.610| 0.3400|
```

Or HTML, which again makes it look great in HTML files (such as this webpage you're reading):

```{r, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(df, format = "html")
```


## The *insight* workflow

The **insight** package also contains function to improve the "printing", or rendering, of tables. Its design dissociates two separate and independent steps: *formatting* and *exporting*.

### Formatting

The purpose of formatting is to improve a given table, while still keeping it as a regular R data frame, so that it can be for instance further modified by the user.


```{r}
format_table(df)
```

As you can see, `format_table()` modifies columns, turning number into characters (so that it has the same amount of digits), and  detecting confidence intervals. This is usually combined with column-specific formatting functions, like `format_p()`:

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(p = format_p(p, stars = TRUE)) %>% 
  format_table()
```


### Exporting

The next step is *exporting*, which takes a data frame and renders it in a given format, so that it looks good in the console, or in markdown, HTML or latex.

For console output, we need to `cat()` the returned result to get nicely printed code:

```{r}
cat(export_table(df))
```

For markdown or HTML, simply modify the `format` argument to markdown ("md")...

```{r}
export_table(df, format = "md")
```

...or HTML format.

```{r}
export_table(df, format = "html")
```

This can be combined with `format_table()`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  format_table(ci_brackets = c("(", ")")) %>% 
  export_table(format = "html")
```

TODO: What about display?
