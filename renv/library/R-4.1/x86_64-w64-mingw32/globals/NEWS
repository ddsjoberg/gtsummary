Package: globals
================

Version: 0.14.0 [2020-11-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now findGlobals(function(x) x <- x) identifies 'x' as a global variable.

 * Now findGlobals(function(x) x[1] <- 0) identifies 'x' as a global variable.
   Same for other variants like x[[1]] <- 0 and x$a <- 0.

 * Now findGlobals(function(z) x <- z$x) identifies 'x' as a global variable.

 * Now findGlobals(quote({ f <- function(x) x; x })) identifies 'x' as a global
   variable.  Previously, the 'x' of the function would hide the global 'x'.


Version: 0.13.1 [2020-10-11]

BUG FIXES:

 * globalsOf() could produce "Error in vapply(where, FUN = envname, FUN.VALUE
   = NA_character_, USE.NAMES = FALSE) : values must be length 1, but 
   FUN(X[[2]]) result is length 10".  This would happen if for instance
   argument 'envir' has attributes set.

 * findGlobals() works around a bug in stats:::`[.formula` of R (< 4.1.0) that
   revealed itself when scanning formulas with NULL components.

 * findGlobals() would not pass down argument 'dotdotdot' when recursively
   parsing assignments.
   
 * findGlobals() could return '...' as a global also when used in formulas.
   Now it respects argument dotdotdot = "ignore" and parses formulas
   accordingly, otherwise formulas will be parsed using dotdotdot = "return".
   

Version: 0.13.0 [2020-09-16]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * findGlobals(expr) now also scans any attributes of 'expr' for globals, e.g.
   purrr::partial() puts the original function in attribute 'body'.  Argument
   'attributes' controls which attributes, if any, should be scanned.  Default
   is to scan all attributes.

 * findGlobals(), globalsOf(), and globalsByName() now recognizes and returns
   values for '..1', '..2', etc. like they do for '...'.

 * cleanup() now also drop exported and non-exported NativeSymbolInfo objects.

NEW FEATURES:

 * cleanup() gained support for dropping NativeSymbolInfo objects.

BUG FIXES:

 * findGlobals() did not pass down argument 'method' in recursive calls.

 * findGlobals(expr) would fail to identify globals in anonymous function
   calls, e.g. expr <- as.call(list(function(...) NOT_FOUND, quote(FOUND))).

 * Calls like findGlobals(~ NULL) with NULLs on the right-hand side could throw
   "Error in if (length(ans) == 0L || as.character(ans[[1L]])[1L] == "~") { : 
   missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". Solved by working around what looks
   like a bug in the 'stats' package causing subsetting on formulas with NULLs
   to fail.

 * cleanup(..., drop = c(..., "base-packages")) for Globals would drop base
   R objects with names not exported by the corresponding base R package.
   Similarly, drop = c(..., "primitive") would drop primitive R objects with
   names not exported by any base R package.

 * findGlobals(), globalsOf(), and globalsByName() did not handle '..1',
   '..2', etc.

 * findGlobals() and globalsOf() produces warnings on '<anonymous>: ... may be
   used in an incorrect context' when formulas had '...', '..1', '..2', etc.

 * findGlobals(function() NULL, substitute = TRUE, trace = TRUE) would throw
   "Error in environment(w$enterLocal) : object 'w' not found".


Version: 0.12.5 [2019-12-07]

BUG FIXES:

 * findGlobals(function() { a; a <- a + 1 }) would fail to identify 'a' as a
   global variable whereas it was properly identified with { a <- a + 1; a }.
 

Version: 0.12.4 [2018-10-11]
 
BUG FIXES:

 * globalsOf() could produce "Error in vapply(where, FUN = envname, 
   FUN.VALUE = NA_character_, USE.NAMES = FALSE) : values must be length 1,
   but FUN(X[[...]]) result is length ...".  This was because the internal
   envname(env) did not always handle when class(env) != "environment".
   

Version: 0.12.3 [2018-09-16]

NEW FEATURES:

  * findGlobals(), globalsOf(), and packagesOf() no longer return elements
    sorted by name.
    
BUG FIXES:
  
  * globals::findGlobals() would not identify 'a' as a global in expressions
    of type 'a[1] = ...' and 'names(a) = ...' although it did for
    'a[1] <- ...' and 'names(a) <- ...'.


Version: 0.12.2 [2018-08-25]

PERFORMANCE:

  * cleanup() for Globals should now be much faster. Previously, it could be
    very slow the first time it was called in a fresh R session, especially
    if the user had a large number of packages installed and/or the package
    libraries were on slow drives.

DOCUMENTATION:

  * Added help for globals::findGlobals().
  
BUG FIXES:

  * globals::findGlobals(x), where 'x' is a list, iterated over 'x' incorrectly
    assuming no method dispatching on 'x' would take place. For instance, if
    'x' contained an fst::fst_table object, then "Error in .subset2(x, i, 
    exact = exact) : subscript out of bounds" would be produced.
    
  * globals::findGlobals() could produce a "Warning in is.na(x): is.na() 
    applied to non-(list or vector) of type 'NULL'" in R (< 3.5.0).


Version: 0.12.1 [2018-06-24]

PERFORMANCE:

  * globals::findGlobals() is now significantly faster for elements that are
    long lists with many elements of basic data types.  This is because
    elements of such basic data type cannot contain globals and can therefore
    be skipped early in the search for globals.
    

Version: 0.12.0 [2018-06-12]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Now globals::findGlobals() identifies 'a' as a global also when it is
    part of LHS expressions of type 'a[1] <- ...' and 'names(a) <- ...'.

BUG FIXES:

  * globals::findGlobals() incorrectly identified 'a' as a global in
    expression of type 'a <- pkg::a'.

  * If "..." was passed to globalsByName(names), an error would be produced
    unless it was the last entry in 'names'.


Version: 0.11.0 [2018-01-09]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now findGlobals() identifies 'x' as a global variable in 'x <- x + 1'
   and likewise for 'x + 1 -> x'.  Note that ditto using `<<-` and `->>`
   was already identifying 'x' as a global.

BUG FIXES:

 o findGlobals(..., trace = TRUE) now outputs only to standard error.
   Previously, some of the output went to standard output.


Version: 0.10.3 [2017-10-12]

BUG FIXES:

 o globalsOf(..., recursive = TRUE) would result in "Error in match.fun(FUN) :
   node stack overflow" if one of the globals identified was a function that
   called itself recursively (either directly or indirectly).


Version: 0.10.2 [2017-08-08]

BUG FIXES:

  * walkAST() could produce error "Cannot walk expression. Unknown object
    type '...'" for objects of type 'environment'.


Version: 0.10.1 [2017-07-01]

BUG FIXES:

  * walkAST() could produce error "Cannot walk expression. Unknown object
    type '...'" for objects of type 'list', 'expression' and 'S4'.


Version: 0.10.0 [2017-04-16]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Globals that are part of a formula are now identified.

  * findGlobals(..., trace = TRUE) will now show low-level parse information
    as the abstract syntax tree (AST) is walked.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

  * Enabled more internal sanity checks.
  
BUG FIXES:

  * walkAST() could produce error "Cannot walk expression. Unknown object
    type 'nnn'" for expressions of type 'builtin', 'closure' and 'special'.
    

Version: 0.9.0 [2017-03-09]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Added option 'globals.debug', which when TRUE enables debugging output.
  
BUG FIXES:

  * globalsOf(..., recursive = TRUE) would in some cases scan an incorrect
    subset of already identified globals.

  * globalsOf(..., recursive = TRUE) failed to skip objects part of package
    namespaces that where defined via a local() statement.


Version: 0.8.0 [2017-01-14]

NEW FEATURES:

  * globalsOf() identifies also globals in locally defined functions.
    This can be disabled with argument recursive = FALSE.

  * findGlobals() now takes both closures (functions) and expressions.
  

Version: 0.7.2 [2016-12-28]

BUG FIXES:

  * c(x, list()) where x is a Globals object would give an error reporting
    that the list does not have named elements.
  
  
Version: 0.7.1 [2016-10-13]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Globals() and as.Globals() now accepts an empty list as input as well.

BUG FIXES:

  * walkAST(quote( function(x=NULL) 0 )) would give a sanity check error due
    to the NULL argument.  Thank you GitHub user billy34 for reporting on this.
  
  
Version: 0.7.0 [2016-09-08]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Added walkAST(), which can be used to tweak expressions.

  * Added globalsByName() for locating and retrieving a set of known global
    variables.

  * Added c(), $<-(), names(), unique() for Globals objects.

  * Improved as.Globals() for lists.
  
  
Version: 0.6.1 [2016-01-31]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Now the error message of globalsOf(..., mustExist=TRUE) when it fails to
    locate a global also gives information on the expression that is
    problematic.

BUG FIXES:

  * cleanup() for Globals did not cleanup functions in core package
    environments named 'package:<name>'.
  
  
Version: 0.6.0 [2015-12-12]

NEW FEATURES:

  * findGlobals() is updated to handle the case where a local variable is
    overwriting a global one with the same name, e.g. { a <- b; b <- 1 }.
    Now 'b' is correctly identified as a global object.  Previously it would
    have been missed.  For backward compatibility, the previous behavior can
    be obtained using argument method="conservative".
  
  
Version: 0.5.0 [2015-10-13]

NEW FEATURES:

  * globalsOf() now returns attribute 'where' specifying where each global
    object is located.

BUG FIXES:

  * cleanup() now only drops objects that are *located* in one of the "base"
    packages; previously it would also drop copies of such objects, e.g.
    FUN <- base::sample.
  
  
Version: 0.4.1 [2015-10-05]

BUG FIXES:

  * globalsOf() failed to return global variables with value NULL.  They were
    identified but silently dropped.
  
  
Version: 0.4.0 [2015-09-12]

NEW FEATURES:

  * findGlobals() and globalsOf() gained argument 'dotdotdot'.

  
Version: 0.3.1 [2015-06-10]

  * More test coverage.
  
  
Version: 0.3.0 [2015-06-08]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Renamed getGlobals() to globalsOf().
  
  
Version: 0.2.3 [2015-06-08]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Added [() for Globals.

  * findGlobals() and getGlobals() gained argument 'substitute'.

  * Added cleanup(..., method="internals").
  
  
Version: 0.2.2 [2015-05-20]

NEW FEATURES:

  * Added Globals class with methods cleanup() and packagesOf().
    Added as.Globals() to coerce lists to Globals objects.
  
  
Version: 0.2.1 [2015-05-20]

NEW FEATURES:

  * getGlobals() gained argument 'mustExist' for controlling whether to give an
    error when the corresponding object for an identified global cannot be
    found or to silently drop the missing global.

  * findGlobals() and getGlobals() gained argument 'method' for controlling
    whether a "conservative" or a "liberal" algorithm for identifying true
    globals should be used.
  
  
Version: 0.2.0 [2015-05-19]

  * Moved globals function from an in-house package to this package.
  
  
Version: 0.1.0 [2015-02-07]

  * Created.
