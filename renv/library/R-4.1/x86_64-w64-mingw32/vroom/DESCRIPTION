Description: The goal of 'vroom' is to read and write data (like
    'csv', 'tsv' and 'fwf') quickly. When reading it uses a quick initial
    indexing step, then reads the values lazily , so only the data you
    actually use needs to be read.  The writer formats the data in
    parallel and writes to disk asynchronously from formatting.
