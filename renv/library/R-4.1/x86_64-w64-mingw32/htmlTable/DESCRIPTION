Description: Tables with state-of-the-art layout elements such as row spanners,
    column spanners, table spanners, zebra striping, and more. While allowing
    advanced layout, the underlying css-structure is simple in order to maximize
    compatibility with word processors such as 'MS Word' or 'LibreOffice'. The package
    also contains a few text formatting functions that help outputting text
    compatible with HTML/LaTeX.
