## gtsummary <a href='https://github.com/ddsjoberg/gtsummary'><img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="120" /></a>

The {gtsummary} package provides an elegant, flexible, concise way to create publication-ready and reproducible analytical tables using the **R** programming language.  The {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities to present results.

* [Summarize **data frames or tibbles**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) easily. Perfect for creating a **Table 1** in **R**, comparing group demographics, and more. Detects continuous, categorical, and binary variables and also includes amount of missingness in each variable.

* [Summarize **regression models**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_regression.html) and include reference rows for categorical variables. Common regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression, are automatically identified and the tables are pre-filled with appropriate column headers (i.e. Odds Ratio, and Hazard Ratio). 

* [**Customize gtsummary tables**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/index.html#section-general-formatting-styling-functions) using a growing list of formatting/styling functions. **[Bold](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/bold_italicize_labels_levels.html)** labels, **[italicize](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/bold_italicize_labels_levels.html)** levels, **[add p-value](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/add_p.html)** to summary tables, **[style](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/style_percent.html)** the statistics however you choose, **[merge](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_merge.html)** or **[stack](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/reference/tbl_stack.html)** tables to present results side by side... there are so many possibilities to reproducibly create the table of your dreams! 

* **Report statistics inline** from summary tables and regression summary tables in **Rmarkdown** with **[Inline Reporting](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html#inline_text)** reporting functions. Make your reports completely reproducible!



By leveraging [{broom}](https://broom.tidyverse.org/), [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/), and [{labelled}](http://larmarange.github.io/labelled/) packages, {gtsummary} creates beautifully formatted, ready-to-share tables in a single line of R code!  

Check out the examples below, review the [vignettes](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/) for a detailed exploration of the output options, and view the [gallery](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/gallery.html) for various customization examples.


## Installation

The {gtsummary} package was written as a companion to the {gt} package from RStudio, and it is recommended to install both {gt} and {gtsummary}.  The {gt} package is not automatically installed. If {gt} is not installed, `knitr::kable()` will be used to produce the summary tables.  You can install {gtsummary} and {gt} with the following code.  

1. Install {gtsummary}

    ``` r
    install.packages("gtsummary")
    ```

1. Install {gt} from GitHub (recommended)

    ``` r
    install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")
    ```

Install the development version of {gtsummary} with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary")
```

## Examples

### Summary Table

```{r t1, include = TRUE}
library(gtsummary)
t1 <-
  tbl_summary(
    data = trial[c("trt", "age", "grade", "response")],
    by = trt
  ) %>%
  add_p() 
```

```{r tbl_summary_print, include = FALSE}
gt::gtsave(as_gt(t1), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

### Regression Models

```{r regress, include = TRUE}
mod1 <- glm(response ~ trt + age + grade, trial, family = binomial)

t2 <- tbl_regression(mod1, exponentiate = TRUE)
```

```{r tbl_regression_print, include = FALSE}
gt::gtsave(as_gt(t2), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

The {gtsummary} [vignettes/tutorials](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/) contain detailed examples.  

Review even more output options in the [table gallery](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/gallery.html).

## Print Engine

{gtsummary} uses the {gt} package to print all summary tables.  In addition to supporting {gt}, the {gtsummary} package works well with `knitr::kable()`.  This is particularly useful when outputting documents to Microsoft Word.  If the {gt} package is not installed, {gtsummary} will fall back to `knitr::kable()`.  To explicitly set the printing engine, set the option in the script or in the user- or project R profile, `.Rprofile`.

    options(gtsummary.print_engine = "kable") 
    
or
    
    options(gtsummary.print_engine = "gt")

Output from {kable} is less full featured compared to summary tables produced with {gt}.  For example, {kable} summary tables do not include indentation, footnotes, and spanning header rows.
