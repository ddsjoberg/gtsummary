# mice 3.12.0

### Much faster predictive mean matching

* The new `matchindex` C function makes predictive mean matching **50 to 600 times faster**. 
The speed of `pmm` is now on par with normal imputation (`mice.impute.norm()`)
and with the `miceFast` package, without compromising on the statistical quality of 
the imputations. Thanks to Polkas <https://github.com/Polkas/miceFast/issues/10> and 
suggestions by Alexander Robitzsch. See #236 for more details.

### New `ignore` argument to `mice`

* New `ignore` argument to `mice()`. This argument is a logical vector 
of `nrow(data)` elements indicating which rows are ignored when creating 
the imputation model. We may use the `ignore` argument to split the data 
into a training set (on which the imputation model is built) and a test 
set (that does not influence the imputation model estimates). The argument
is based on the suggestion in 
<https://github.com/amices/mice/issues/32#issuecomment-355600365>. See #32 for 
more background and techniques. Crafted by Patrick Rockenschaub

### New `filter()` function for `mids` objects

* New `filter()` method that subsets a `mids` object (multiply-imputed data set).
The method accepts a logical vector of length `nrow(data)`, or an expression
to construct such a vector from the incomplete data. (#269). 
Crafted by Patrick Rockenschaub.

### Changes affecting reproducibility

* **Breaking change:** The `matcher` algorithm in `pmm` has changed to `matchindex`
for speed improvements. If you want the old behavior, specify `mice(..., use.matcher = TRUE)`.

### Minor changes

* Corrected installation problem related to `cpp11` package (#286)
* Simplifies `with.mids()` by calling `eval_tidy()` on a quosure. Does not yet solve #265.
* Improve documentation for `pool()` and `pool.scalar()` (#142, #106, #190 and others)
* Makes `tidy.mipo` more flexible (#276)
* Solves a problem if `nelsonaalen()` gets a `tibble` (#272)
* Add explanation to how `NA`s can appear in the imputed data (#267)
* Add warning to `quickpred()` documentation (#268)
* Styles all sources files with styler
* Improves consistency in code and documentation
* Moves internally defined functions to global namespace
* Solves bug in internal `sum.scores()`
* Adds deprecated messages to `lm.mids()`, `glm.mids()`, `pool.compare()`
* Removes `.pmm.match()` and `expandcov()`
* Strips out all `return()` calls placed just before end-of-function
* Remove all trailing spaces
* Repairs a bug in the routine for finding the `printFlag` value (#258)
* Update URL's after transfer to organisation `amices`

# mice 3.11.0

## Major changes

* The Cox model does not return `df.residual`, which caused problematic behavior in the `D1()`, `D2()`, `D3()`, `anova()` and `pool()`. `mice` now extracts the relevant information from other parts of the objects returned by `survival::coxph()`, which solves long-standing issues with the integration of the Cox model (#246).
* Adds missing `Rccp` dependency to work with `tidyr 1.1.1` (#248).

## Minor changes

* Addresses warnings: `Non-file package-anchored link(s) in documentation object`.
* Updates on `ampute` documentation (#251).
* Ask user permission before installing a package from `suggests`.

# mice 3.10.0

## Major changes

* New functions `tidy.mipo()` and `glance.mipo()` return standardized output that conforms to `broom` specifications. Kindly contributed by Vincent Arel Bundock (#240).

## Minor changes

* Solves a problem with the `D3` testing script that produced an error on CRAN (#244).

# mice 3.9.0

## Major changes

* The `D3()` function in `mice` gave incorrect results. This version solves a problem in the calculation of the `D3`-statistic. See #226 and #228 for more details. The documentation explains why results from `mice::D3()` and `mitml::testModels()` may differ.
* The `pool()` function is now more forgiving when there is no `glance()` function (#233)
* It is possible to bypass `remove.lindep()` by setting `eps = 0` (#225)

## Minor changes

* Adds reference to Leacy's thesis
* Adds an example to the `plot.mids()` documentation

# mice 3.8.0

## Major changes 

* This version adds two new NARFCS methods for imputing data under the *Missing Not at Random (MNAR)* assumption. NARFCS is generalised version of the so-called $\delta$-adjustment method. Margarita Moreno-Betancur and Ian White kindly contributes the functions `mice.impute.mnar.norm()` and `mice.impute.mnar.logreg()`. These functions aid in performing sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of different MNAR assumptions on the conclusion of the study. An alternative for MNAR is the older `mice.impute.ri()` function.
* Installation of `mice` is faster. External packages needed for imputation and analyses are now installed on demand. The number of dependencies as estimated by `rsconnect::appDepencies()` decreased from 132 to 83.
* The name clash with the `complete()` function of `tidyr` should no longer be a problem.
* There is now a more flexible `pool()` function that integrates better with the `broom` and `broom.mixed` packages.

## Bug fixes

* Deprecates `pool.compare()`. Use `D1()` instead (#220)
* Removes everything in `utils::globalVariables()`
* Prevents name clashes with `tidyr` by defining `complete.mids()` as an S3 method for the `tidyr::complete()` generic (#212)
* Extends the `pool()` function to deal with multiple sets of parameters. Currently supported keywords are: `term` (all `broom` functions), `component` (some `broom.mixed` functions) and `y.values` (for `multinom()` model) (#219)
* Adds a new `install.on.demand()` function for lighter installation
* Adds `toenail2` and remove dependency on `HSAUR3`
* Solves problem with `ampute` in extreme cases (#216)
* Solves problem with `pool` with `mgcv::gam` (#218)
* Adds `.gitattributes` for consistent line endings

# mice 3.7.0

* Solves a bug that crashed `mids2spss()`, thanks Edgar Schoreit (#149)
* Solves a problem in the routing logic (#149) causing that passive 
imputation was not done when no predictors were specified. No passive
imputation correctly will ignore any the specification of 
`predictorMatrix`.
* Implements an alternative solution for #93 and #96. Instead of skipping 
imputation of variables without predictors, `mice 3.3.1` will impute 
those variables using the intercept only
* Adds a routine contributed by Simon Grund that checks for deprecated 
arguments #137

# mice 3.0.0 
         
Version 3.0 represents a major update that implements the 
following features: 

1. `blocks`: The main algorithm iterates over blocks. A block is
    simply a collection of variables. In the common MICE algorithm each 
    block was equivalent to one variable, which - of course - is 
    the default; The `blocks` argument allows mixing univariate 
    imputation method multivariate imputation methods. The `blocks` 
    feature bridges two seemingly disparate approaches, joint modeling 
    and fully conditional specification, into one framework;

2. `where`: The `where` argument is a logical matrix of the same size 
    of `data` that specifies which cells should be imputed. This opens 
    up some new analytic possibilities;
    
3.  Multivariate tests: There are new functions `D1()`, `D2()`, `D3()`
    and `anova()` that perform multivariate parameter tests on the 
    repeated analysis from on multiply-imputed data;

4. `formulas`: The old `form` argument has been redesign and is now 
    renamed to `formulas`. This provides an alternative way to specify
    imputation models that exploits the full power of R's native 
    formula's. 

5.  Better integration with the `tidyverse` framework, especially 
    for packages `dplyr`, `tibble` and  `broom`;
   
6.  Improved numerical algorithms for low-level imputation function. 
    Better handling of duplicate variables.

7.  Last but not least: A brand new edition AND online version of
    [Flexible Imputation of Missing Data. Second Edition.](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/)

# mice 2.0 - 26-08-2009 / SvB, KO 	Major upgrade for JSS manuscript

* ADDED:   new functions cbind.mids(), rbind.mids(), ibind()
* ADDED:   new argument in mice(): 'post' in post-processing imputations
* ADDED:   new functions: pool.scaler(), pool.compare(), pool.r.squared()
* ADDED:	 new data: boys, popmis, windspeed
* FIXED:	 function summary.mipo all(object$df) command fixed
* REMOVED: data.frame.to.matrix replaced by the internal data.matrix function
* ADDED:   new imputation method mice.impute.2l.norm() for multilevel data
* CHANGED: pool now works for any class having a vcov() method
* ADDED:   with.mids() provides a general complete-data analysis
* ADDED:   type checking in mice() to ensure appropriate imputation methods
* ADDED:   warning added in mice() for constant predictors
* ADDED:   prevention of perfect prediction in mice.impute.logreg() and mice.impute.polyreg()
* CHANGED: mice.impute.norm.improper() changed into mice.impute.norm.nob()
* REMOVED: mice.impute.polyreg2() deleted
* ADDED:    new 'include' argument in complete()
* ADDED:    support for the empty imputation method in mice()
* ADDED:    new function md.pairs()
* ADDED:    support for intercept imputation
* ADDED:    new function quickpred()

# mice 1.21 - 15/3/2009 SvB  Maintainance release

* FIXED:   Stricter type checking on logicals in mice() to evade warnings.
* CHANGED: Modernization of all help files.
* FIXED:   padModel: treatment changed to contr.treatment
* CHANGED: Functions check.visitSequence, check.predictorMatrix, check.imputationMethod are now coded as local to mice()
* FIXED:   existsFunction in check.imputationMethod now works both under S-Plus and R

# mice 1.16 - 6/25/2007

* FIXED: The impution function impute.logreg used convergence criteria that were too optimistic when fitting a GLM with glm.fit. Thanks to Ulrike Gromping.

# mice 1.15 - 01/09/2006

* FIXED: In the lm.mids and glm.mids functions, parameters were not passed through to glm and lm.

# mice 1.14R - 9/26/2005 11:44AM
* FIXED: Passive imputation works again. (Roel de Jong)
* CHANGED: Random seed is now left alone, UNLESS the argument "seed" is specified. This means that unless you
specify identical seed values, imputations of the same dataset will be different for multiple calls to mice. (Roel de Jong)
* FIXED:  (docs): Documentation for "impute.mean" (Roel de Jong)
* FIXED: Function 'summary.mids' now works (Roel de Jong)
* FIXED: Imputation function 'impute.polyreg' and 'impute.lda' should now work under R
