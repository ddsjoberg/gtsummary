\title{Other Vignettes}
\author{Terry Therneau}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

A parallel source for the survival package is the therneau/survival directory on
github.
This copy contains several extra vignettes, in the vignette2 directory, that
are not part of the CRAN copy.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item tutorial.Rnw: This works through the examples found in the excellent
     tutorial by H. Putter, M. Fiocco and R. Geskus. 
     Tutorial in biostatistics: competing risks and multi-state models,
     Statistics in Medicine, 2006.
   \item sas.Rnw: An expanded discussion answering some repeated queries about 
     how survival package results differ from SAS.
   \item tests.Rnw: A harder look at what SAS ``type 3'' tests are.
   \item singer.Rnw: Worked examples from a texbook by Singer and Willett.
\end{enumerate}

Number 1 is not on CRAN because it makes use of a data set from the mstate 
package.  As a recommended package survival cannot depend on anything outside
of the base + recommended R.  (A minimally sufficient set that is self contained
is useful for R maintainance and validation.)
Number 2 delves into relative computing time questions, and those examples take
a very long time to run.
Material in the third vigette is now discussed at a higher level in the 
population estimate and adjusted survival curves vignettes.

In time, we expect this set of other vignettes to grow.
