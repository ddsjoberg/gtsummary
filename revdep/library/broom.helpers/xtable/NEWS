1.8-4 (2019-04-8)

  * Changes to spdep broke vignette Other Packages Gallery, reported
    by CRAN. Had to remove spdep, splm and sphet suggests and xtable
    functions, and references in OtherPackagesGallery
  
    
1.8-3 (2018-08-29)

  * Changed listOfTablesGallery vignette to exclude references to
    lsmeans since Russell Lenth has deprecated lsmeans, replacing it
    with emmeans which has support for tables using xtable based on
    listOfTables. lsmeans removed from Suggests in DESCRIPTION also. 
  * Changed OtherPackagesGallery vignette example using the function
    impacts from spdep due to a change in the package spdep causing a
    failure ofr the example using gstslshet from sphet
  * Changed error messages to extract actual value of nrow(x),
    suggestion by Michael Chirico <michaelchirico4@gmail.com>
  * Corrected author field to properly represent author contributions,
    code supplied by Arni Magnusson <arnima@hafro.is>
  * Corrected call to print.xtable inside print.xtableFtable included
    arguments from call to print.xtableFtable. Absence of size
    argument was advised by Lluis Ramon, email March 4, 2016
  * Added patch from Martin Gubri, martin.gubri@framasoft.org to
    enable use of lagImpactMat from spdep in xtable method lagImpact.
  * Added patch to code in OtherPackagesGallery.Rnw supplied by Martin
    Gubri to avoid warnings in the spdep package example. Also fixed the
    vignette index entry.
  * Fixed number of columns in \multicolumn command in print.xtableList to
    deal with inclusion of row names. Previously was only appropriate for
    row names not included.

1.8-2 (2016-02-05)
  * Added function print.xtableMatharray to enable easy creation of
    LaTeX code to enable an array to be included in a document.
  * Added example to the gallery using sanitizing headings and row
    names to produce large bold headings and italic row names.
  * Added code from Martin Gubri, martin.gubri@framasoft.org, to produce
    tables from the spatial econometrics packages, spdep, splm, and
    sphet.
  * Extracted sanitize functions from print.xtable as stand-alone
    functions, and exported them. Added helper functions as.is and
    as.math for assistance with sanitization (supplied by Stefan
    Edwards <sme@iysik.com> in Feature Request #5303).
  * Added option to produce math style exponents when sanitizing
    numbers, as suggested by Don Armstrong <don@donarmstrong.com>, who
    also provided code
  * Fixed bug #6907. Warning was created when the data frame as no
    rows for type is 'html'. Added a test to create the matrix
    requested specially in that case. Original code was
    BTD2 <- matrix(align.tmp[(2-pos):(ncol(x)+1)],
                   nrow = nrow(x), ncol = ncol(x)+pos, byrow = TRUE)
    which created a matrix with no rows, but gave a warning when
    there were no rows in the data frame being processed.
  * Fixed bug #6260. Accepted the change suggested by Claudius
    Loehnert, which was to replace { and } by \begingroup and
    \endgroup respectively as the delimiters when size was to changed
    in a table.
  * Added functions xtableList and print.xtableList to produce
    composite tables consisting of a number of subtables.
  * Added xtableFtable and print.xtableFtable to format flat tables
    produced by ftable. Included examples in the xtable gallery.
  * Produced new vignettes: 'The xtableList Gallery' to illustrate
    xtableList and print.xtableList; and 'The Other Packages Gallery'
    to illustrate methods for classes of objects from other packages.

1.8-0 (2015-11-02)
  * autoformat, xalign, xdigits, xdisplay from Arni Magnusson, added
    along with help file. Feature request #5686.
  * New argument 'auto' in xtable(), to call xalign, xdigits, and
    xdisplay at the time when xtable is created.
  * Updated xtableGallery vignette, now with TOC and revised examples.

1.7-4 (2014-09-11)
  * Changed tags in HTML to be all lower case, to be compatible with
    HTML5, part of feature request. (#5879)
  * Fixed booktabs bug (#2309), more of an enhancement really. Updated
    xtableGallery.snw to illustrate the change.

1.7-3 (2014-03-06)
  * Dealt with format.args bug (#4770). No code changes, but the
    documentation of print.xtable was changed to warn of the problem
    and to give a workaround as an example.

1.7-1 (2013-02-24)
  * Fixed logicals bug. (Req #1911)
  * Changed implementation of centering of tables. Instead of
    inserting a centered environment, now a \centering command is
    inserted. (Req #2104)
  * Allow for margin tables as possible with document class
    tufte-handout. An example of usage is found in the vignette.
    produced by margintable.Rnw which is in inst/doc. (Req #2168)
  * Added "timestamp" argument to print.xtable().  Set it to NULL
    if no timestamp is desired. (Req #2246)
  * Added "comment" argument to print.xtable().  Set it to FALSE
    to exclude the version and timestamp comment. (Req #2246)
  * Added "caption.width" argument.  If not NULL then the caption
    is placed in a "parbox" of the specified width. (Req #2247)
  * Remove the check on whether the "floating.environment" is in a
    list of known floating environments. Users want to use floating
    environments from multiple options LaTeX packages. (Req #2488,
    #2578)

1.7-0 (2012-02-10)
  * Added some vectorization code to improve performance.
  * Let "caption" be length 2, in which case the second value is
    the short caption used when creating a list of tables.
  * Added "toLatex" method.
  * Included "print.xtable" in the exported methods in the NAMESPACE file.
  * Added "print.results" argument to "print" that can be used to
    suppress the printing.
  * Added "format.args" argument to "print" that can be used to
    pass additional arguments such as "big.marks" to "formatC()".
  * Added "rotate.colnames" and "rotate.rownames" arguments to
    "print.xtable".
  * Added "booktabs" argument to use the "\toprule", "\midrule", and
    "\bottomrule" tags from the Latex "booktabs" package rather than
    using "\hline" for all horizontal lines.
  * Added "scalebox" argument to include a "\scalebox" clause around
    the tabular environment with the specified value used as the
    scaling factor.
  * Added "width" argument to allow specification of the width
    value in tabular environments such as "tabularx".
  * Added "X" as an allowed alignment value in the "align()"
    replacement function.
  * Changed the "print.xtable()" arguments to use "getOption()"
    to check the options for a default value.  This was suggested
    since "print.xtable()" has a lot of arguments that the user
    will typically leave unchanged between tables.
  * Added an "is.null()" check on the "table.placement" argument.
  * Added examples using the new arguments to the vignette.

1.6-0 (2011-10-07)
  * Allow "table*" as a value for "floating.environment" in print.xtable().
  * Fix bug under which multiple logical columns were formatted incorrectly.
  * Stop with an error if "xtable.table" is used on a table with more than
    two dimensions.
  * Add some newlines to "Rd" file to prevent lines from extending off the
    page in the PDF version of the help files.
  * Changed the maintainer to "Charles Roosen".
  * Created an "xtable" project on R-Forge.

1.5-6 (2009-10-30)
  * Support caption at the top in the LaTeX longtable.
  * Use options()$OutDec for decimal mark.

1.5-5 (2009-03-24)
  * Added html.table.attributes to set the attributed of the <TABLE> tag for
    HTML tables.
  * Accommodated logicals by converting to characters.
  * Add an extra space at end of each line for LaTeX tables.
  * Fixed typographical error in documentation.
