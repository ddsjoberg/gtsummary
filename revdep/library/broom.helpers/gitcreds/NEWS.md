# gitcreds 0.1.1

* gitcreds now works with older git versions on Windows. It should work
  without any configuration for git 2.12.1 or later, and with minimal
  configuration for git 2.9.2 - git 2.12.0. See `?gitcreds_get` for more.

* git errors have now better error messages, they include the output
  from git as well.

* The `git-auth.R` file is now standalone, and can be embedded into
  other packages.
