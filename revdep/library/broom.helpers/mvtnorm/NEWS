Changes in version 1.1-1 (2020-06-09)

  o  allow to turn-off symmetry checks (patch contributed by Feng Li <feng.li_at_cufe.edu.cn>

Changes in version 1.1-0 (2020-02-24)

  o  replace MVPHI and MVPHNV by calls to R's {p,q}norm5, following
     a suggestion by Benjamin Christoffersen <boennecd_at_gmail.com>


Changes in version 1.0-12 (2020-01-06)

  o  fix Rdiff issues

Changes in version 1.0-11 (2019-06-19)

  o  improve documentation and error messages

Changes in version 1.0-10 (2019-03-04)

  o  eliminate warning when calling qmvt with arg sigma = 1 


Changes in version 1.0-9 (2019-02-28)

  o  adapt to recent changes in r-devel


Changes in version 1.0-8 (2018-05-31)

  o  pmvt(..., sigma = ) was ignored in the univariate case
     (reported by Alec Stephenson)

  o  documentation updates

Changes in version 1.0-7 (2018-01-25)

  o  pmvt(..., df = ) is scalar only

Changes in version 1.0-6 (2017-03-01)

  o  use registered C routines

Changes in version 1.0-5 (2016-02-02)

  o  improvements in quantile estimation

Changes in version 1.0-4 (2016-01-19)

  o  a new algorithm for quantile estimation, again. Quantiles are 
     now computed by a stochastic root finding algorithm. Note
     that f.quantile in the output of qmv{t,norm} is now (again)
     the squared difference between the cdf evaluated at the
     quantile and the level. The \code{interval} argument to the 
     quantile functions is used as a starting value for the
     root finder when available.

  o  clean-ups in C and R code and documentation

Changes in version 1.0-3 (2015-07-21)

  o  new algorithm for quantile estimation. Quantiles are 
     now computed by minimising the squared distance between the 
     distribution function and the probability whereas previous versions
     used uniroot(). The procedure is now performed multiple times with
     difference random seeds in order to stabilise the results. The
     \code{interval} argument to the quantile functions is IGNORED now.

Changes in version 1.0-2 (2014-12-16)

  o  start providing C interfaces to the underlying algorithms.
     mvtnorm_C_mvtdst() directly calls Alan's FORTRAN code and
     can be used in other packages via LinkingTo. See
     mvtnorm/inst/C_API_Example for an example very much inspired
     by the example provided in package xts.

  o  provide .C interfaces to the FORTRAN routines and allow switching
     on/off of R' RNG.

Changes in version 1.0-1 (2014-11-11)

  o  replace internal MVCHNV FORTRAN FUNCTION with
     R's sqrt(qchisq(p, n, FALSE, FALSE). This fixes a
     problem where NaN was returned as reported by
     David Charles Airey <airey_david_charles_at_lilly.com>

Changes in version 1.0-0 (2014-07-08)

  o  After 14 years, we now feel safe enough to publish mvtnorm 1.0-0.
     Many packages depend, import, or suggest mvtnorm, so this version
     change also indicates that the package is now stable and, to a very
     large extent, the API is frozen. We will of course continue to fix 
     bugs or other problems but new features are unlikely to go into this
     package.

  o  use Authors@R in DESCRIPTION

  o  switch to standard NEWS format

Changes in version 0.9-99992 (2014-05-03)

Changes in version 0.9-9997 (2014-01-17)

  o  T. Miwa fixed a runtime error in miwa.c reported by UB sanitizer

Changes in version 0.9-9996 (2013-09-16)

  o  documentation updates/corrections/examples by Marius Hofert

  o  df = Inf

  o  rmvt(): argument 'mean' not allowed anymore (prone to misuse)

  o  pmvnorm(lower=c(-Inf, 0, 0), upper=c(0, Inf, Inf),
             mean=c(0, 0, 0), sigma=S, algorithm = Miwa())
     returned NaN, fixed by Xuefei Mi


Changes in version 0.9-9995 (2013-05-29)

  o  update to version 2013-06-29 of mvtdst.f from Alan's website
     (fixed a bug for 2-dim pmvt)

Changes in version 0.9-9994 (2012-12-06)

  o  set.seed(29)
     rmvnorm(10, ...)

     produces the same first ten rows as

     set.seed(29)
     rmvnorm(100, ...)

  o  as suggested by Paul Johnson <pauljohn_at_ku.edu>. There is a new
     argument pre0.9_9993 for changing back to the `old' output. This
     _DOES NOT_  apply to rmvt.

Changes in version 0.9-9993 (2012-10-22)

  o  sigma is called `scale' matrix of {dpq}mvt, thanks to
     Richard Boys <Richard.Boys_at_ncl.ac.uk> for the hint

  o  qmvt(..., df = 0, ...) gave NaN

  o  R CMD check works on x64 with GCC 4.6.2 (Debian 4.6.2-11)

Changes in version 0.9-9991 (2011-06-10)

  o  tvpack wasn't working on 64bit machines. The reason
     was that the wrapper SUBROUTINEs around the original
     FUNCTIONs didn't return the appropriate double precision
     for unknown reasons. Redefining TVTL and BVTL as FUNCTIONs
     fixed the problem.

Changes in version 0.9-999 (2011-04-26)

  o  still problems in fix approx_interval (when !is.null(sigma));
     disable for the time being

  o  use fixed interval when sigma is specified in qmvt

Changes in version 0.9-95 (2010-11-18)

  o  allow for two different noncentral t distributions (via type
     argument)

  o  be a little more liberal (tol = sqrt(.Machine$double.eps))
     when testing for symmetry of covariance matrices
     (and make R CMD CHECK monomvn happy again)


Changes in version 0.9-1 (2008-07-02)

     dimensions by Miwa's method thanks to Tetsuhisa Miwa and Xuefei Mi;
     both have been added as `authors'.

     for motivating the update and for checking the new version.

  o  rmvnorm() now can also use a Cholesky decomposition to compute
     the root of sigma (thanks to Fabian Scheipl)
