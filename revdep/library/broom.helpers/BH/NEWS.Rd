    adjusted accordingly

    and \rfticket{2768}. 
    \item The package can now also be used to compile CRAN package
    \CRANpkg{ExactNumCI} and \CRANpkg{rcppbugs}.
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 1.51.0-0 (2013-01-31)}{
  \itemize{
    \item First CRAN upload
    \item The package can be used to build \CRANpkg{bigmemory} and
    \CRANpkg{RcppBDT} as it already contains significant portions of Boost libraries
    algorithm, bind, concept, config, container, date_time, detail,
    exceptions, filesystem, functional, interprocess, intrusive, iterator,
    math, mpl, numeric, preprocessor, random, range, smart_ptr,
