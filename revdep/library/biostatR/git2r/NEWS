* Make it easier to view and change the timezone (John Blischak in
  #408).

* Fixed 'ls_tree' to handle content in subfolder, see description in
  PR #402.

* The 'branch_create' function has been changed to use the

git2r 0.26.1
------------

BUG FIXES

* Fixed the broken build on Solaris.

git2r 0.26.0
------------

  existing tag.

* Allow a zero length tag message.

* Make it possible to create a lighweight tag.

* Added the 'ref' argument to the 'commits' function to give a
  reference to list commits from.

* Added the utility function 'lookup_commit' to lookup a commit
  related to a git object.

* The 'path' argument was added to the 'commits' function to make it
  possible to specify that only commits modifying this file ('path')
  will be returned to reproduce 'git log' with '--no-follow', see the
  documentation. (Peter Carbonetto and John Blischak in PR #372)

BUG FIXES

* Removed the timezone offset from the commit time to fix an incorrect
  time in GMT when reading information from a repository (Thierry
  Onkelinx in PR #393).

git2r 0.25.2
------------

CHANGES

* Improved the build configuration script: if the system installation
  of libgit2 is to old, use the bundled libgit2 instead of raising an
  error.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed the broken build on Solaris.

git2r 0.25.1
------------

BUG FIXES

* Fixed significant warning from 'R CMD check'

git2r 0.25.0
------------

CHANGES

* Updated the bundled libgit2 source code to version '0.28.1'.

* Added additional parameters to the 'diff' function to control the
  output, see the documentation.

* Added getPass option to the password argument in 'cred_user_pass'
  (Annie Wang in PR #383)

BUG FIXES

* Fixed memory protection errors in the git2r C source code reported
  by the 'rchk' tool.

* Raise an error if the path argument to the 'hashfile' function is
  NA.

git2r 0.23.0
------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated the bundled libgit2 source code to v0.27.3 (504bd54).

BREAKING CHANGE

* On macOS, git2r no longer enables SSH transport by default. This is
  due to the complexity to build the dependencies for SSH transport in
  an R package when macOS no longer ships the OpenSSL headers.
  However, you can install git2r from source on macOS (see the 'R
  Installation and Administration' manual) with SSH transport enabled
  if you first install the libgit2 library, for example, using the
  Homebrew package manager. Another possibility is to let the build
  configuration automatically download the libgit2 library from the
  Homebrew package manager with:

  install.packages('git2r', type='source', configure.vars='autobrew=yes')

git2r 0.22.1
------------

NEW FEATURES

* Added the 'git_config_files' method to locate configuration files.

* Added the 'stash_pop' method to apply a single stashed state from
  the stash list and remove it from the list if successful.

* Added the 'stash_apply' method to apply a single stashed state from
  the stash list.

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated the bundled libgit2 source code to v0.27.2 (8d36dc6).

* git2r can now build against a system installation of libgit2
  (Elliott Sales de Andrade in PR #345, #344 and #336).

* Refactoring of the configuration scripts to use a prebuilt libgit2
  on macOS and Windows (Thanks Jeroen).

* Ensure that git2r writes the config file to the correct location on
  Windows (John Blischak in PR #320).

* Better default location to find ssh keys in 'cred_ssh_key()' (Ian
  Lyttle in PR #317).

BUG FIXES

* If a merge results in no change, the returned 'git_merge_result' now returns
  'FALSE' for 'fast_forward' and 'conflicts' and 'NA' for 'sha'. Previously it
  returned 'logical(0)' for 'fast_forward' and 'conflicts' and 'character(0)'
  for 'sha'.

BREAKING CHANGES

* Changed from S4 classes to S3 classes to simplify the design and
  facilitate future development.

* Removed the trailing slash from the directory name when reporting
  repository path or workdir.

* Removed the 'libgit2_sha' method. Use the 'libgit2_version' method
  instead.

* Changed the 'stash_drop' argument 'index' from zero-based to
  one-based i.e. use index = 1 to drop the first stash.

git2r 0.21.0
------------

* Added methods 'odb_blobs' and 'odb_objects' with missing repository
  signature. Internally, they use 'getwd' and 'discover_repository' to
  open a repository.

BUG FIXES

* The bundled libgit2 source code has been reverted to libgit2 v0.26.0
  (15e1193) from 14 June 2017 (same as in git2r v0.19.0) to fix memory
  alignment errors.

git2r 0.20.0
------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated the bundled libgit2 source code to commit (fa8cf14) from 16
  December 2017.

* Improvements to the build configuration script.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed the internal callback for remote host authentication from
  hanging indefinitely when querying an ssh-agent for
  credentials. Now, the callback signals an error instead of trying
  again if the authentication failed the first time.

git2r 0.19.0
------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated the bundled libgit2 source code to commit (15e1193)
  (v0.26.0) from 14 June 2017.

* Added 'checkout' argument to 'clone()'. Allows to control whether
  checkout of HEAD is performed after the clone is complete. Setting
  'checkout=FALSE' has similar effect as the git command line option
  '--no-checkout'. Andrzej K. Oles in #282.

BUG FIXES

* Fixed memory protection errors in the git2r C source code reported
  by the 'rchk' tool.

* Added missing calls to 'R_forceSymbols' and 'R_useDynamicSymbols' in
  the C init function.

* Enable argument 'all' to commit multiple modified (or deleted)
  files. John Blischak in #283

  machine earlier in order to fix an unsupported architecture error
  encountered on CentOS (#268, #288).

git2r 0.18.0
------------

------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated the bundled libgit2 source code to commit (6b0510e) from 20
  December 2016.

  package with SSH transport enabled. Version 1.8.0 of LibSSH2 is
  downloaded and built from 'https://www.libssh2.org/download/'.

git2r 0.16.0
------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated libgit2 source code to commit (6b0510e) from
  17 November 2016.

* Add the option 'all_untracked' to the 'status' method to show
  individual files in untracked directories if the 'untracked' option
  is TRUE.

* Add the 'tag_delete' method to delete an existing tag reference.

* Update build configuration to support OpenSSL 1.1.0.

* If the the 'getPass' package is installed the 'cred_ssh_key' method
  to create a new passphrase-protected ssh key credential object will
  call the 'getPass::getPass()' method if the private key is
  passphrase protected to allow for interactive input of the
  passphrase. The 'getPass' package is a suggested package. (Peter
  Meissner in PR #254)

* Add 'path' argument to the 'reset' method to enable path-specific
  unstage, i.e. resets the index entries for all paths to their state
  at HEAD

BUG FIXES

* Build configuration: use portable string equality comparison
  operator. This fixes the build e.g. for those without Bash as
  /bin/sh. (Sander Maijers in PR #243).

git2r 0.15.0
------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Build configuration: 'pkg-config' is now used to find 'libssl', if
  possible (Elias Pipping in PR #231).

* Added a method to coerce a 'git_commit' object to a 'data.frame'.

* Added the method 'is_branch' to check if an object is a
  'git_branch'.

BUG FIXES

* Build configuration: fixed installation with parallel make (Kirill
  MÃ¼ller in PR #228).

git2r 0.14.0
------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated libgit2 source code to commit (785d8c48) from
  2016-03-04. This is release v0.24.0 of libgit2.

* Refactoring of the build scripts.

* Added a check that the configuration key is valid when setting a
  configuration variable and output a warning if the key is invalid.

* The status method now prints "working directory clean" instead of
  nothing when the working directory is clean.

* Added the 'refspec' argument to the 'fetch' method to specify the
  refs to fetch and which local refs to update.

* Added a workaround to the 'commit' method to list commits in a
  shallow clone since the libgit2 library does not yet support this.

git2r 0.13.1
------------

BUG FIXES

* This is a bug-fix release to solve problems introduced in version
  0.12.1:

  - The bundled libgit2 source code has been reverted to commit
    (98f7bd2) from 2015-08-05 (same as in v0.11.0) to fix memory
    alignment errors (clang-UBSAN and gcc-UBSAN).

  - OpenSSL is now used again on OS X to provide the cryptographic
    support for HTTPS connections to fix a significant compiler
    warning (arithmetic on a pointer to void is a GNU extension
    [-Wpointer-arith]) on r-devel-osx-x86_64-clang.

  - Several fixes to the build configuration on non-Windows platforms.

* Improvments to the cred_* functions documentation.

* Add the following default arguments to the 'cred_ssh_key' method:
  publickey = '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' and privatekey = '~/.ssh/id_rsa'

* On OSX, cascade CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to libssh2 build to allow
  libssh2 to be built against a user-installed openssl, discovered by
  configure or from R's Makeconf. Necessary to build on OS X â¥ 10.11

* On OS X, SecureTransport is now used to provide the cryptographic
  support for HTTPS connections insead of OpenSSL.

* The search for libssh2 during configuration (non Windows) is now
  done via pkg-config.

  working directory.

* Add name of branch to each item in branch_list.

* Add name of tag to each item in tags list.

* Add S4 class 'cred_env' to pass credentials in environment

  'OpenSSL'. These two libraries are downloaded from
  'https://github.com/rwinlib' during configuration of the package.

* Static linking of LibSSH2 on OSX to support redistributable binary
  package with SSH transport enabled. Version 1.6.0 of LibSSH2 is
  downloaded and built from 'https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2'.
