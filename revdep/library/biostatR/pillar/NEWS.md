# pillar 1.4.7

- Adapt to changed environment on CRAN's Solaris machine.


# pillar 1.4.6

- Restore compatibility with R 3.2.


# pillar 1.4.5

## Features

- New `pillar.min_chars` option allows controlling the minimum number of characters shown for a character column (#178, @statsmaths).

- `bit64::integer64()` columns are now formatted the same way as numeric columns (#175).

- New `align()` to support easy alignment of strings within a character vector (existing function exported by @davidchall, #185).

## Technical

- `pillar_shaft()`, `format_type_sum()` and `extra_cols()` issue a warning if dots are unused.

- `new_pillar_title()` and `new_pillar_type()` warn if `...` is not empty.

## Internal

- Use lifecycle package.

- Remove compatibility code for R < 3.3.


# pillar 1.4.4

- `obj_sum()` uses `vctrs::vec_size()` internally.

- `is_vector_s3.default()` is soft-deprecated and no longer used. Please ensure that `vctrs::vec_is()` is `TRUE` for your class.

- Rely on vctrs for type abbreviations.


# pillar 1.4.3

- `new_pillar_shaft_simple()` gains `na` argument to control appearance of `NA` values.

- String columns are quoted if at least one value needs quotes (#171).

- Apply subtle style to `list_of` columns (#172).

- Fix formatting if mantissa is very close to 1 (#174).

- Use `as.character()` instead of `as_character()`.

- Remove compatibility with testthat < 2.0.0.


# pillar 1.4.2

- List columns are shown with their perceived dimensions, which may be different from those stored in the `"dim"` attribute. Regression introduced in 1.4.0 (#167).

- Add ellipsis to `vec_ptype_abbr()` method.


# pillar 1.4.1

- More careful specification of minimum package versions for the dependencies (#165).
- Fix `type_sum.vctrs_vctr()` that also led to a NOTE in `R CMD check`.
- Resolve `vec_is()` at runtime instead of during `.onLoad()` (#163, @lionel-).
- Implement methods for vctrs objects.


# pillar 1.4.0

## Breaking changes

- `type_sum()` forwards to `vctrs::vec_ptype_abbr()` (#134). This makes sure that `list_of` columns (for values of the same type) are properly displayed. The value returned for `factor` and `complex` remains unchanged, because this will change in vctrs.
- The `class` argument to `new_pillar_shaft()` deprecates the existing `subclass` argument. Passing a `subclass` argument leads to a warning once per session (#157).

## Output

- Removed extra space for pillars with a negative value of lower magnitude than the largest positive value (example: -1 and 23).
- 0-col tibble and matrix columns are now formatted with a capital containing `[,0]` and an empty shaft (#149).

## Performance

- `squeeze()` is now faster (because the width computation in `pillar_shaft.numeric()` now uses more arithmetics instead of string concatenation). Further speedups may require implemetation of crucial parts in C (#147).
- Styling output is faster: an expensive check for availability of colored output is carried out only once per call to `colonnade()`, and styling is implemented manually (#133, @jimhester).

## Internal

- All internal S3 classes have the `pillar_` prefix (#156).
- Only check native output on Windows, due to subtle differences when running on Linux in a latin1 locale.


# pillar 1.3.1

## Bug fixes

- Fix off-by-one error in distribution of empty space (#141).

## Visible changes

- `NA` in names is no longer escaped with backticks.
- Don't add quotes for pillars formatted with their `format()` method (tidyverse/tibble#448).

## Internal changes

- Update base type abbrevs to rlang 0.3.0 (#140, @lionel-).
- Tests work again in a 256-color terminal (#129).


# pillar 1.3.0

## Visible changes

- Unknown data types are formatted using `format()`, not `as.character()` (#120).

- Multi-tier colonnades can always fill the last tier, even if the width isn't a proper multiple of `getOption("width")`. (Example: `options(width = 80, tibble.width = 200)` will print a wide tibble in three tiers, each 80 characters wide, with a total width of 240 characters.)

- Fixed mixed formatting (showing some pillars with maximum, and some with minimum width). If a pillar's minimum width is smaller than `getOption("width")`, it is shown nevertheless, abbreviated with dots if necessary.

## Interface changes

- `format_type_sum()` gains `width` argument (#73).

## Performance improvements

- Printing large multi-tier colonnades is much faster, the code that distributes pillars over tiers uses a much simpler and much faster algorithm (tidyverse/tibble#422).

- Printing is now faster overall, because less work is done for formatting in "subtle" style (gray of a fixed level), and because `fansi::strip_sgr()` is used instead of `crayon::strip_style()`.

- Slightly faster printing of colonnades by reusing an intermediate result.

## Internal

- `pillar()` no longer adds backticks if `title` is non-syntactic.

- `colonnade()` supports data frames and matrices. When printing, each sub-column is shown individually, using a title that resembles the syntax used to access it. Also supports recursively nested data frames (with data frame or matrix columns).

- Added fuzz tests for character colonnades of varying widths.

- Use `fansi::substr_ctl()` in favor of `crayon::col_substr()`.


# pillar 1.2.3

- Eliminate CRAN check warning about undeclared withr dependency.
- More defensive test to address CRAN check failures on Solaris.
- `colonnade()` now handles pillars named `"sep"` (#115).
- `pillar_shaft.character()` gains `min_width` argument.


# pillar 1.2.2

- Whole numbers are printed without a decimal dot again. Numbers that are the result of a whole number divided by a power of 10 (subject to a tolerance to account for floating-point imprecision) are shown without trailing decimal zeros, even if these zeros are significant according to the `pillar.sigfig` option (#105).
- New `new_pillar_title()` and `new_pillar_type()` to support consistent output in `glimpse()` (#31).
- New `format_type_sum()` generic that allows overriding the formatting of the type summary in the capital (#73).
- The `digits.secs` option is respected when computing the width for date-time values (#102).


# pillar 1.2.1

Display
-------

- Turned off using subtle style for digits that are considered insignificant.  Negative numbers are shown all red.  Set the new option `pillar.subtle_num` to `TRUE` to turn it on again (default: `FALSE`).
- The negation sign is printed next to the number again (#91).
- Scientific notation uses regular digits again for exponents (#90).
- Groups of three digits are now underlined, starting with the fourth before/after the decimal point. This gives a better idea of the order of magnitude of the numbers (#78).
- Logical columns are displayed as `TRUE` and `FALSE` again (#95).
- The decimal dot is now always printed for numbers of type `numeric`. Trailing zeros are not shown anymore if all displayed numbers are whole numbers (#62).
- Decimal values longer than 13 characters always print in scientific notation.

Bug fixes
---------

- Numeric values with a `"class"` attribute (e.g., `Duration` from lubridate) are now formatted using `format()` if the `pillar_shaft()` method is not implemented for that class (#88).
- Very small numbers (like `1e-310`) are now printed corectly (tidyverse/tibble#377).
- Fix representation of right-hand side for `getOption("pillar.sigfig") >= 6` (tidyverse/tibble#380).
- Fix computation of significant figures for numbers with absolute value >= 1 (#98).

New functions
-------------

- New styling helper `style_subtle_num()`, formatting depends on the `pillar.subtle_num` option.


# pillar 1.1.0

- `NA` values are now shown in plain red, without changing the background color (#70).
- New options to control the output, with defaults that match the current behavior unless stated otherwise:
    - `pillar.sigfig` to control the number of significant digits, for highlighting and truncation (#72),
    - `pillar.subtle` to specify if insignificant digits should be printed in gray (#72),
    - `pillar.neg` to specify if negative digits should be printed in red,
    - `pillar.bold` to specify if column headers should be printed in bold (default: `FALSE`, #76),
    - `pillar.min_title_chars` to specify the minimum number of characters to display for each column name (default: 15 characters, #75).
- Shortened abbreviations for types: complex: cplx -> cpl, function: fun -> fn, factor: fctr -> fct (#71).
- Date columns now show sub-seconds if the `digits.secs` option is set (#74).
- Very wide tibbles now print faster (#85).
