CODA was conceived and motivated by Mary Kathryn Cowles, who developed the
original program as part of her PhD thesis concerning practical issues
in implementing the Gibbs sampler.  It was modified by Nicky Best to
provide software suitable for general release, including contributions
by Karen Vines.  Martyn Plummer ported CODA to R and modified the code
so that the user is not bound by the menu-driven interface.

All authors, and the MRC Biostatistic Unit, have given permission for
