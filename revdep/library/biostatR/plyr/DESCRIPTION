Description: A set of tools that solves a common set of
    problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces,
    operate on each piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For
    example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or
    time point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse
    high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development
    of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton Dickinson'.
