        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.5

        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.4

BUG FIXES

  o hi_andre() may fail to find highlight under OS X (thanks, Christopher
  Gandrud, #2)

MINOR CHANGES

  o :: and ::: are recognized as operators, and they will be syntax highlighted
  in the same way as other operators like +, -, *, and /, etc (thanks, Qiang Li,
  #3)

        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.3

BUG FIXES

  o blank lines were not preserved in previous versions; now they can be
  correctly preserved

  o hilight() works when the code is only a comment; fixed the bug reported
  at http://stackoverflow.com/q/18548020/559676 which was actually due to
  the bug of utils::getParseData() in R 3.0.1

  o Linux Mint has a built-in version of highlight under /usr/local/bin/
  which is not Andre Simon's highlight, and this can hang highr
  (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/knitr/nicYgzqhwX8)

MINOR CHANGES

  o the package vignettes were built with the knitr::docco_classic engine;
  see vignette(package = 'highr')

        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.2.1

MINOR CHANGES

  o fixed a test that failed under R 2.15.x due to the keep.source argument
  in parse(), which was not available in R until R 3.0.0

        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

  o added a new argument 'fallback' in hilight(); for R < 3.0.0, we can use
  hilight(..., fallback = TRUE), which is a rough syntax highlighting method
  based on regular expressions (hence less accurate and comphrehensive than
  the getParseData() approach); as a result, highr no longer has to depend
  on R 3.0.0, although it is recommended to use R 3.0.0


        CHANGES IN highr VERSION 0.1

NEW FEATURES

  o the first version of highr: a hilight() function based on
  utils::getParseData() to do syntax highlighting for R code; hi_andrew() as
  a wrapper for Andre Simon's Highlight package
