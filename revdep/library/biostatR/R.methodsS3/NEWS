Package: R.methodsS3
====================

Version: 1.8.1 [2020-08-24]

 * BUG FIXES: R.methodsS3 would produce "Warning: partial match of 'Date' to
   'Date/Publication'" when attached if options(warnPartialMatchDollar=TRUE).


Version: 1.8.0 [2020-02-13]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now setGenericS3() produces an error if it can not turn an existing function
   into a "default" function and create a new generic function.  Previously,
   it produced a warning.
   
NEW FEATURES:

 * Now setGenericS3() sets the 'S3class' attribute on any "default" methods
   it creates, if any.

 * Add internal function R.methodsS3:::makeNamespace(pkg) for producing
   S3method() statements to be put in a package's NAMESPACE file.

CODE QUALITY:

 * Now formally suggesting 'codetools'.

BUG FIXES:

 * R.methodsS3::setMethodS3() could produce 'Error in appendVarArgs(
   ...R.oo.definition) : could not find function "appendVarArgs"' if the
   R.methodsS3 package is not attached.

 * setMethodS3() and setGenericS3() failed to detect names 'NA_real_' etc.
   as R keywords due to an 11 year old bug.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT:

 * R.methodsS3::throw() is deprecated.  Use base::stop(), or R.oo::throw(),
   instead.
   

Version: 1.7.1 [2016-02-15]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * CLEANUP: Package now requires R (>= 2.13.0) (April 2011).  If really needed
   on earlier version of R, it only takes a minor tweak, but I won't do that
   unless really really needed.

CODE QUALITY:

 * Explicit namespace imports also from 'utils' package.


Version: 1.7.0 [2015-02-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * CONSISTENCY: Now isGenericS4() returns FALSE for non-existing functions,
   just as isGenericS3() does.

CODE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added several package tests.

BUG FIXES:

 * isGenericS3() on a function gave error "object 'Math' of mode 'function'
   was not found" when the 'methods' package was not loaded, e.g.
   Rscript -e "R.methodsS3::isGenericS3(function(...) NULL)".

 * findDispatchMethodsS3() could in rare cases return an extra set of false
   functions in R (< 3.1.2).  This was due to a bug in R (< 3.1.2) where the
   output of getAnywhere() contained garbage results, e.g.
   getAnywhere(".Options")$objs.  For backward compatibility,
   findDispatchMethodsS3() now detects this case and works around it.  This
   bug was only detected after adding an explicit package test for
   findDispatchMethodsS3().


Version: 1.6.2 [2014-05-04]

CODE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: Internal directory restructuring.


Version: 1.6.1 [2014-01-04]

CODE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped obsolete argument 'ellipsesOnly' from setGenericS3().
   It was not used.  Thanks Antonio Piccolboni for reporting on this.


Version: 1.6.0 [2013-11-12]

BUG FIXES:

 * Generic function created by setGenericS3("foo<-") would not have a last
   argument name 'value', which 'R CMD check' complains about.


Version: 1.5.3 [2013-11-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now setMethodS3(name, class, ...) and setGenericS3(name, ...)
   assert that arguments 'name' and 'class' are non-empty.


Version: 1.5.2 [2013-10-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * BETA: Added an in-official option to make setGenericS3() and setMethodsS3()
   look for existing (generic) functions also in imported namespaces.  This
   will eventually become the default.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now isGenericS3() also compares to known generic functions in
   the 'base' package.  It also does a better job on checking whether the
   function calls UseMethod() or not.

 * Added argument 'inherits' to getGenericS3().

 * The above improvement of isGenericS3() means that setGenericS3() does a
   better job to decided whether a generic function should be created or not,
   which in turn means 'createGeneric = FALSE' is needed much less in
   setMethodS3().


Version: 1.5.1 [2013-09-15]

BUG FIXES:

 * Forgot to explicitly import capture.output() from 'utils' which could give
   an error on function "capture.output" not available when setMethodS3() was
   used to define a "replacement" function.  This was only observed on the
   R v3.0.1 release version but not with the more recent patched or devel
   versions. In addition, two other 'utils' functions are now explicitly
   imported.


Version: 1.5.0 [2013-08-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added pkgStartupMessage() which acknowledges library(..., quietly = TRUE).


Version: 1.4.5 [2013-08-23]

CODE QUALITY:

 * CLEANUP: No longer utilizing ':::' for "self" (i.e. R.methodsS3) methods.

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped deprecated inst/HOWTOSITE replaced by inst/CITATION.


Version: 1.4.4 [2013-05-19]

CODE QUALITY:

 * CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.


Version: 1.4.3 [2013-03-08]

CODE QUALITY:

 * Added an Authors@R field to the DESCRIPTION.


Version: 1.4.2 [2012-06-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now setMethodS3(..., appendVarArgs = TRUE) ignores 'appendVarArgs' if
  the method name is "==", "+", "-", "*", "/", "^", "%%", or "%/%",
  (in addition to "$", "$<-", "[[", "[[<-", "[", "[<-").  It will also
  ignore it if the name matches regular expressions "<-$" or "^%[^%]*%$".
  The built in RCC validators were updated accordingly.


Version: 1.4.1 [2012-06-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'overwrite' to setGenericS3().


Version: 1.4.0 [2012-04-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now setMethodS3() sets attribute "S3class" to the class.

 * Added argument 'export' to setMethodS3() and setGenericS3(), which sets
   attribute "export" to the same value.


Version: 1.3.0 [2012-04-16]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now only generic funcions are exported, and not all of them.

 * Now all S3 methods are properly declared in NAMESPACE.


Version: 1.2.3 [2012-03-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now arguments '...' of setMethodS3() are passed to setGenericS3().


Version: 1.2.2 [2011-11-17]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped example(getMethodS3), which was for setMethodS3().


Version: 1.2.1 [2010-09-18]

BUG FIXES:

 * isGenericS3(), isGenericS4(), getGenericS3() and getMethodS3() failed to
   locate functions created in the global environment while there exist a
   function with the same name in the 'base' package. The problem only affected
   the above functions and nothing else and it did not exist prior to
   R.methodsS3 v1.2.0 when the package did not yet have a namespace.  Thanks
   John Oleynick for reporting on this problem.

 * isGenericS3() and isGenericS4() did not support specifying the function by
   name as a character string, despite it was documented to do so.  Thanks
   John Oleynick for reporting on this.


Version: 1.2.0 [2010-03-13]

CODE QUALITY:

 * Added a NAMESPACE.


Version: 1.1.0 [2010-01-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getDispatchMethodS3() and findDispatchMethodsS3().


Version: 1.0.3 [2008-07-02]

CODE QUALITY:

 * Renamed HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 1.0.2 [2008-05-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getMethodS3() and getGenericS3().

BUG FIXES:

 * isGenericS3() and isGenericS4() gave an error if a function was passed.


Version: 1.0.1 [2008-03-06]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added paper to citation("R.methodsS3").

BUG FIXES:

 * Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) some locale, e.g.
   'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify the ASCII alphabet is to
   list all characters explicitly, which we now do in all methods of the
   package.  See the r-devel thread "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on
   2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 1.0.0 [2007-09-17]

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES:

 * Created by extracting setMethodS3() and related methods from the R.oo
   package.  The purpose is to provide setMethodS3() without having to load
   (the already lightweight) R.oo package.  For previous history related to
   the methods in this package, please see the history of the R.oo package.
