# diffobj

## v0.3.1-2

* [#150](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/150): Make tests compatible
  with new `testthat` release (h/t @hadley).
* Remove pre-built vignettes and note `testthat` change to `waldo` release.

## v0.3.0

* [#143](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/143): Add `ses_dat` to
  provide a more computable version of `ses` (h/t @hadley).
* [#144](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/144): Re-encode strings to
  UTF-8 prior to comparison to avoid spurious encoding-only differences (h/t
  @hadley).
* [#142](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/142): Typos in
  `standardGeneric` in trim/guide generic definitions.
* Drop attributes from inputs to `diffChr` (revealed as an issue by #142).
* Banish ghosts of `stringsAsFactors`.

## v0.2.4

* Tests explicitly set `stringsAsFactors=TRUE` so they don't fail with the
  anticipated changed for R4.0.
* [#140](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/140): Bad link in `?ses`.

## v0.2.3

This is a bugfix release.

* [#136](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/136): Documentation for
  `ignore.white.space` (h/t @flying-sheep) and `max.diffs` parameters listed
  incorrect defaults.
* [#135](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/135): Incorrect handling of
  potential meta data strings when unwrapping atomics would cause a "wrong sign
  in by argument" error (h/t @flying-sheep).  We also fixed other bugs related
  to the handling of meta data in atomic vectors that were uncovered while
  debugging this issue.
* [#134](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/134): Forwarding `...` to
  `diff*` functions no longer breaks substitution of arguments for diff banners
  (h/t @noamross)..
* [#133](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/133): `diffFile` considers
  files with equal content but different locations to be `all.equal` now (h/t
  @noamross).
* [#132](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/132): Duplicate pager slot
  for baseline `Pager` removed (h/t Bill Dunlap).

There are also several other small internal changes that in theory should not
affect user facing behavior.

## v0.2.2

* Set `RNGversion()` due to changes to sampling mechanism.

## v0.2.0-1

### Features

* [#129](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/129): Allow pager
  specification via lists rather than full `Pager` objects for easier changes to
  defaults.  As part of this we changed `StyleRaw` objects to use default
  pager instead of `PagerOff`.
* [#126](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/126): Add embedding diffs in
  Shiny to vignette.
* [#119](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/119): `ignore.whitespace` now
  also ignores white space differences adjoining punctuation.
* [#118](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/118): New option to preserve
  temporary diff file output when using pager (see `?Pager`).
* [#114](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/114): New options `strip.sgr`
  and `sgr.supported` allow finer control of what happens when input already
  contains ANSI CSI SGR and how ANSI CSI SGR is handled in string manipulations.
  Related to this, `options(crayon.enabled=TRUE)` is no longer set when
  capturing output prior to diff as it used to be.  By default pre-existing ANSI
  CSI SGR is stripped with a warning prior to comparison.

### Bugs

* [#131](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/131): Fix missing slot in S4
  class definition (discovered by Bill Dunlap).
* [#127](https://github.com/brodieG/diffobj/issues/127): Width CSS conflicts
