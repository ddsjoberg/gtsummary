This vignette is meant for those who wish to contribute to {gtsummary}, or users who wish to gain an understanding of the inner-workings of a {gtsummary} object so they may more easily modify them to suit your own needs.
If this does not describe you, please refer to the [{gtsummary} website](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) to an introduction on how to use the package's functions and tutorials on advanced use.

## Introduction

Every {gtsummary} object has a few characteristics common among all objects.
Here, we review those characteristics, and provide instructions on how to construct a {gtsummary} object.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(gtsummary)
library(purrr); library(dplyr); library(tibble)

tbl_regression_ex <-
  lm(age ~ grade + marker, trial) %>%
  tbl_regression() %>%
  bold_p(t = 0.5) 

tbl_summary_ex <-
  trial %>%
  select(trt, age, grade, response) %>%
  tbl_summary(by = trt)
```

## Structure of a {gtsummary} object

Every {gtsummary} object is a list comprising of, at minimum, these elements:

```r
.$table_body    .$table_header         
```

#### table_body

The `.$table_body` object is the data frame that will ultimately be printed as the output.
The table must include columns `"label"`, `"row_type"`, and `"variable"`.
The `"label"` column is printed, and the other two are hidden from the final output.

```{r}
tbl_summary_ex$table_body
```

#### table_header

The `.$table_header` object is a data frame containing information about each of the columns in `.$table_body` (one row per column in `.$table_body`).
The table header has the following columns:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tribble(
  ~Column, ~Description,
  "column", "Column name from table_body",
  "label", "Label that will be displayed (if column is displayed in output)",
  "hide", "Logical indicating whether the column is hidden in the output",
  "align", "Specifies the alignment/justification of the column, e.g. 'center' or 'left'",
  "missing_emdash", "Indicates the rows to include an em-dash for missing cells. For example `row_ref == TRUE` in `tbl_regression()`",
  "indent", "String of R code that results in a logical vector that specifies rows to indent, e.g. `row_type != 'label'`",
  "text_interpret", "the {gt} function that is used to interpret the column label",
  "bold", "For columns that bold rows conditionally, the column includes a string of R code that results in a logical vector indicating the rows to bold For example, `row_type == 'label'`",
  "italic", "For columns that italicize rows conditionally, the column includes a string of R code that results in a logical vector indicating the rows to italicize. For example, `row_type == 'label'`",
  "fmt_fun", "If the column needs to be formatted, this list column contains the function that performs the formatting.  Note, this is the function object; not the character name of a function.",
  "footnote_abbrev", "Lists the abbreviation footnotes for a table.  All abbreviation footnotes are collated into a single footnote.  For example, 'OR = Odds Ratio' and 'CI = Confidence Interval' appear in a single footnote.",
  "footnote", "Lists the footnotes that will appear for each column.",
  "spanning_header", "Includes text printed above columns as spanning headers. See `tbl_merge(...)$table_header` output for example of use."
) %>%
  knitr::kable() 
```

NOTE: Columns 'hide', 'align', 'missing_emdash', 'indent', 'bold', and 'italic' MUST follow the tidyverse style guidelines and include spaces around any variable names, e.g. `row_type == 'label'` (NOT `row_type=='label'`).

Example from `tbl_regression()`

```{r} 
tbl_regression_ex$table_header
```

## Constructing a {gtsummary} object

#### table_body

When constructing a {gtsummary} object, the author will begin with the `.$table_body` object.
Recall the `.$table_body` data frame must include columns `"label"`, `"row_type"`, and `"variable"`.
Of these columns, only the `"label"` column will be printed with the final results.
The `"row_type"` column typically will control whether or not the label column is indented.
The `"variable"` column is often used in the `inline_text()` family of functions, and merging {gtsummary} tables with `tbl_merge()`.

```{r}
tbl_regression_ex %>%
  pluck("table_body") %>%
  select(variable, row_type, label)
```

The other columns in `.$table_body` are created by the user and are likely printed in the output.
Formatting and printing instructions for these columns is stored in `.$table_header`.

### table_header

The `.$table_header` has one row for every column in `.$table_body` containing instructions how to format each column, the column headers, and more.
There are a few internal {gtsummary} functions to assist in constructing and modifying a `.$table_header` data frame.

First is the `table_header_fill_missing()` function.
This function ensures `.$table_header` contains a row for every column of `.$table_body`.
If a column does not exist, it is populated with appropriate default values.

```{r}
gtsummary:::table_header_fill_missing(
  table_header = tibble(column = names(tbl_regression_ex$table_body))
) 
```

The `modify_header_internal()` is useful for assigning column headers.
The function accepts a complete {gtsummary} object as its input, and returns an updated version where the column labels have been added to `.$table_header`.
The function also switches the default `.$table_header$hide` from `TRUE` to `FALSE`, resulting in column with labels being printed.

## Printing a {gtsummary} object

All {gtsummary} objects are printed with `print.gtsummary()`.
But before a {gtsummary} object is printed, it is converted to a {gt} object using `as_gt()`.
This function takes the {gtsummary} object as its sole input, and uses the information in `.$table_header` to construct a list of {gt} calls that will be executed on `.$table_body`.
After the {gtsummary} object is converted to {gt}, it is then printed as any other {gt} object.

In some cases, the package defaults to printing with `knitr::kable()` utilizing the `as_kable()` function.

While the actual print function is slightly more involved, it is basically this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print.gtsummary <- function(x) {
  if (getOption("gtsummary.print_engine") == "gt") {
    return(as_gt(x) %>% print())
  }
  else if (getOption("gtsummary.print_engine") == "kable") {
    return(as_kable(x) %>% print())
  }
}

```
