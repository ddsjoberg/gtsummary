```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Any gtsummary table can be placed into a [Shiny application](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
The trick is that the gtsummary must first be converted into a gt table using the `as_gt()` function.
Once the table is a proper gt table, we can use the methods from the gt package to place the table in the Shiny app. Read more about creating Shiny applications with gt table here [https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/gt_output.html](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/gt_output.html).

Save the script below locally as `app.R` in a R Project, open in RStudio, and run the application to see a live example.

```r
library(gtsummary)
library(shiny)
library(gt)

# create a gtsummary table
gtsummary_table <-
  trial %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt, 
    include = c(age, grade)
  )

# convert the gtsummary table to a gt table
gt_table <- as_gt(gtsummary_table)

# create the Shiny app
ui <- fluidPage(
  gt_output(outputId = "table")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$table <- render_gt(expr = gt_table)
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
