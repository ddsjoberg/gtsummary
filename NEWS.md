# gtsummary 1.0.0 

First release since major refactoring.  The {gt} package is now used as the backend to create all tables.  Some function names have been modified to be more in line with other {gt} function calls, and additional functions have been added.  The API for some functions has also been updated.  Review documentation and vignettes for details.

### Updated Function Names

```r
    tbl_summary()       <-  fmt_table1()  
    tbl_regression()    <-  fmt_regression()  
    tbl_uvregression()  <-  fmt_uni_regression()  
    style_pvalue()      <-  fmt_pvalue()  
    style_percent       <-  fmt_percent()  
    style_ratio         <-  fmt_beta()  
```

### New Functions

```r
    tbl_survival()          as_gt()  
    tbl_merge()             style_sigfig()  
    add_nevent()            gtsummary_logo()
```
