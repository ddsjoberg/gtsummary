* `tbl_stack()` fix for `tbl_uvregression` objects (#175)

* Option to exclude some variables from testing when using `add_p()` (#164)

* Updates after {gt} package renamed `cells_style()` to `cell_text()` (#78)

# gtsummary 1.1.1

* Modified `tbl_merge()` to accommodate `tbl_stack()` object (#167)

* Bug fix with incorrect column order in `tbl_summary()` with 10+ levels of by variable (#166)

# gtsummary 1.1.0

* Added {tidyselect} and {gtsummary} variable select functions (#146)

* Added `tbl_stack()` function (#152)

* Bug fix for dichotomous yes/no variables in `tbl_summary` (#158)

# gtsummary 1.0.0 

First release since major refactoring.  The {gt} package is now used as the backend to create all tables.  Some function names have been modified to be more in line with other {gt} function calls, and additional functions have been added.  The API for some functions has also been updated.  Review documentation and vignettes for details.

### Updated Function Names

```r
    tbl_summary()       <-  fmt_table1()  
    tbl_regression()    <-  fmt_regression()  
    tbl_uvregression()  <-  fmt_uni_regression()  
    style_pvalue()      <-  fmt_pvalue()  
    style_percent       <-  fmt_percent()  
    style_ratio         <-  fmt_beta()  
```

### New Functions

```r
    tbl_survival()          as_gt()  
    tbl_merge()             style_sigfig()  
    add_nevent()            gtsummary_logo()
```
