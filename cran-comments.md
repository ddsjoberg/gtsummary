## Reverse dependency checks

## revdepcheck results

We checked 29 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 1 potential new problem with the 'MiscMetabar' package. I investigated, and it looks like a false positive related to a Java dependency unrelated to 'gtsummary'.
