## Additional Comments

Re-submitting to CRAN with no changes except an increment in the version number.
CRAN notified me a couple of weeks ago a package in our Suggests had been removed from CRAN, and we needed to submit a new version. 
Shortly, that package was returned to CRAN. 
I wrote back to CRAN saying the package had returned and all the checks resolved. 
I incorrectly assumed everything was fine when I did not hear back.
However, gtsummary was removed from CRAN and I am now re-submitting. 

Thank you for your time.
