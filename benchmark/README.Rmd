```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  out.width = "100%"
)

# this script installs versions of gtsummary, runs benchmarks, and summarizes results
source(here::here("benchmark", "benchmark_gts.R"))
```

## Execution times

**`tbl_sumary()`**

```{r echo = FALSE}
gg_bench_tbl_summary
```
  
The functions used for the benchmark are:

  `simple = tbl_summary(trial)`  
  
  `complex = tbl_summary(trial, by = trt) %>% add_overall() %>% add_p() %>% add_q(quiet = TRUE) %>% add_n()`

  `big_data = big_trial %>% select(age, grade, trt) %>% tbl_summary(by = trt, missing = "no") %>% add_p()` 
  (NOTE: `big_trial` is a 5000-fold copy of `gtsummary::trial`)
