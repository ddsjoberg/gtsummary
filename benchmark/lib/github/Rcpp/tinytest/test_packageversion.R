## note that v could now be a three or four element vector depending on what the package version is

## construct a release string from the first three elements, ie "1.0.3" from 1.0.3.1
relstr <- as.character(as.package_version(paste(v[1:3], collapse=".")))


## call C++ function returning list of six values, three each for 'release' and 'dev' version

## basic check: is the #defined version equal to the computed version (issue #1014)
