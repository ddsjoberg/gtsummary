Description: Provides a mechanism for chaining commands with a
    new forward-pipe operator, %>%. This operator will forward a value, or
    the result of an expression, into the next function call/expression.
    There is flexible support for the type of right-hand side expressions.
    For more information, see package vignette.  To quote Rene Magritte,
    "Ceci n'est pas un pipe."
