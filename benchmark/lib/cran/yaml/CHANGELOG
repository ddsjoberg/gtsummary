  - add eval.expr option to yaml.load function
  - fix issue with error.label argument (patch by Gregory R. Warnes)

    protection stack in order to appease rchk
  - use MARK_NOT_MUTABLE instead of SET_NAMED, which is deprecated
  - show warning when duplicate map key is ignored during a merge

  - update LibYAML to 0.1.7

v2.1.13
  - fix integer overflow issue
  - explicitly cast pointers from char to yaml_char_t, and vice versa

v2.1.12
  - properly emit factors with NAs (bug submitted by Jenny Bryan)
  - update LibYAML to 0.1.6

v2.1.11
  - update LibYAML to 0.1.5

v2.1.10
  - properly escape names in data frames and lists (bug submitted
    by Paul Hodor)
  - remove extra digit in Windows when formatting exponential numbers

v2.1.9
  - CRAN maintainers changed memcpy to memmove

v2.1.8
  - properly emit and consume numeric values in scientific
    notiation (bug submitted by Gergely Daróczi)
  - add 'precision' argument to as.yaml to control how many digits
    are printed when emitting

v2.1.7
  - properly emit and consume special values: Inf, -Inf, NaN, NA, TRUE,
    and FALSE (bug submitted by Richard Cotton)
    - Inf is emitted as '.inf'
    - -Inf as '-.inf'
    - NaN as '.nan'
    - TRUE is now emitted as 'yes', and FALSE as 'no'
  - because the YAML specification does not specify how to handle NA values,
    the various NA types are emitted as follows:
    - NA: .na
    - NA_real_: .na.real
    - NA_integer_: .na.integer
    - NA_character_: .na.character

v2.1.6

    and Aleksandar Blagotić)

    by Markus Göker)

v2.1.2
  - fix multiple anchor bug (bug submitted by apshaar)

v2.1.1
  - remove redundant yaml-package help page
  - fix solaris compilation error
  - remove printf/assert symbols from the compiled library

v2.1.0
  - re-wrote as.yaml in C (using libyaml's emitter)
  - removed the `pre.indent` option to as.yaml, mainly because libyaml
    doesn't support pre-indention and I'm not sure the option is useful
    anymore; will revisit if requested

v2.0.0
  - switch from the Syck parser to the libyaml (0.1.4) parser
  - changed behavior:
    - sequences of sequences no longer collapse when they contain the same
      type; ex: yaml.load("[1, [2, 3], 4]") returns list(1L, c(2L, 3L), 4L)
