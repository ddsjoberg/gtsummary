  error indicating the file is invalid (thanks, Tyler Rinker,
  hadley/staticdocs#66)

  o markdownToHTML(text = ?, output = ?) was broken (#54)

			      CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.5

  Contributed by Henrik Bengtsson.

  (see browseVignettes('markdown'))

  o the default CSS style was tweaked (major changes include: page width is
  at most 800px, more line height, slightly larger fonts, and a different
  syntax highlighting theme)

			      CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.3

NEW FEATURES

  o added a new argument 'template' to markdownToHTML() so that we can
  customize the HTML template (by default, it uses the template
  'resources/markdown.html' in this package); thanks, Nacho Caballero

  o the options markdown.HTML.stylesheet and markdown.HTML.header used in
  markdownToHTML() can be character vectors (they will be processed by

  as lines of input now, i.e. if 'text' is provided, it is passed to the
  markdown renderer as paste(text, collapse = '\n'); in the previous
  versions, it was processed by paste(text, collapse = '')

  current working directory now when it contains images that need to
  be base64 encoded
