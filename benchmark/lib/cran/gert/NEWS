1.2.0
  - New git_stat_files() function.

1.1.0
  - On x86_64 Linux systems where libgit2 is too old or unavailable, we automatically
    try to download a precompiled static version of libgit2. This includes CentOS 7/8
    as well as Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. Therefore the PPA should no longer be needed.
    You can opt-out of this by setting an envvar: USE_SYSTEM_LIBGIT2=1
  - Add tooling to manually find and set the location of the system SSL certificates
    on such static builds, and also for Solaris.
  - Add several functions to work with submodules.
  - Globally enable submodule-caching for faster diffing.
  - Refactor internal code to please rchk analysis tool.
